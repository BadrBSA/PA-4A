      "Harry Potter, an orphan boy living with his abusive aunt and uncle, receives a letter on his eleventh birthday inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unbeknownst to Harry, he is a famous survivor of Voldemort, a dark wizard who had tried to kill him as an infant. At Hogwarts, Harry learns about his magical abilities from his kind mentor, Professor Albus Dumbledore, and makes new friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trio hears rumors of a legendary Philosopher's (Sorcerer's) Stone that can turn any metal into gold and produce the Elixir of Life, granting immortality. Harry learns that Voldemort is after this stone to regain his youth and power. With Dumbledore's guidance, they embark on a quest to protect the stone from falling into Voldemort's hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trio faces numerous challenges, including battling trolls, cheating in exams, and dealing with a mischievous house-elf named Dobby. They eventually reach the stone's location in the Chamber of Secrets, where they encounter Tom Riddle, Voldemort's former self, who had been trapped there for centuries. Harry manages to outsmart Riddle and save the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Harry returns the Philosopher's Stone to Dumbledore, who uses it to restore the school's damaged library. Harry also learns that Voldemort cannot kill him because a part of Voldemort's soul is connected to Harry through the protective spell cast by Lily Potter, Harry's mother, at the time of his death. This revelation leaves a significant impact on Harry and sets the stage for future events in the series.\n"

      "which, as an honest man, I can't approve. It is one of their customs to\n",
      "write in books what they have done and seen, instead of telling them in\n",
      "their villages, where the lie can be given to the face of a cowardly\n",
      "boaster, and the brave soldier can call on his comrades to witness for\n",
      "the truth of his words. In consequence of this bad fashion, a man who is\n",
      "too conscientious to misspend his days among the women, in learning the\n",
      "names of black marks, may never hear of the deeds of his fathers, nor\n",
      "feel a pride in striving to outdo them. For myself, I conclude the\n",
      "Bumppos could shoot, for I have a natural turn with a rifle, which must\n",
      "have been handed down from generation to generation, as, our holy\n",

      "should be loth to answer for other people in such a matter. But every\n",
      "story has its two sides; so I ask you, Chingachgook, what passed,\n",
      "according to the traditions of the redmen, when our fathers first met?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence of a minute succeeded, during which the Indian sat mute; then,\n",
      "full of the dignity of his office, he commenced his brief tale, with a\n",
      "solemnity that served to heighten its appearance of truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Listen, Hawkeye, and your ear shall drink no lie. 'Tis what my fathers\n",
      "have said, and what the Mohicans have done.\" He hesitated a single\n",
      "instant, and bending a cautious glance toward his companion, he\n",
      "continued, in a manner that was divided between interrogation and\n",
      "assertion, \"Does not this stream at our feet run towards the summer,\n",
      "until its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It can't be denied that your traditions tell you true in both these\n",
      "matters,\" said the white man; \"for I have been there, and have seen\n",
      "them; though, why water, which is so sweet in the shade, should become\n",
      "bitter in the sun, is an alteration for which I have never been able to\n",
      "account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the current!\" demanded the Indian, who expected his reply with that\n",
      "sort of interest that a man feels in the confirmation of testimony, at\n",
      "which he marvels even while he respects it; \"the fathers of Chingachgook\n",
      "have not lied!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Holy Bible is not more true, and that is the truest thing in\n",
      "nature. They call this up-stream current the tide, which is a thing soon\n",
      "explained, and clear enough. Six hours the waters run in, and six hours\n",
      "they run out, and the reason is this: when there is higher water in the\n",
      "sea than in the river, they run in, until the river gets to be highest,\n",
      "and then it runs out again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The waters in the woods, and on the great lakes, run downward until\n",
      "they lie like my hand,\" said the Indian, stretching the limb\n",
      "horizontally before him, \"and then they run no more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No honest man will deny it,\" said the scout, a little nettled at the\n",
      "implied distrust of his explanation of the mystery of the tides; \"and I\n",
      "grant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level.\n",
      "But everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the\n",
      "small scale, the 'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In\n",
      "this manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may\n",
      "be stagnant, as you and I both know they are, having seen them; but when\n",
      "you come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the\n",
      "earth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well\n",
      "expect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile\n",
      "above us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at\n",
      "this very moment!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If unsatisfied by the philosophy of his companion, the Indian was far\n",
      "too dignified to betray his unbelief. He listened like one who was\n",
      "convinced, and resumed his narrative in his former solemn manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We came from the place where the sun is hid at night, over great plains\n",
      "where the buffaloes live, until we reached the big river. There we\n",
      "fought the Alligewi, till the ground was red with their blood. From the\n",
      "banks of the big river to the shores of the salt lake, there was none to\n",
      "meet us. The Maquas followed at a distance. We said the country should\n",
      "be ours from the place where the water runs up no longer on this stream,\n",
      "to a river twenty suns' journey toward the summer. The land we had taken\n",
      "like warriors, we kept like men. We drove the Maquas into the woods with\n",
      "the bears. They only tasted salt at the licks; they drew no fish from\n",
      "the great lake; we threw them the bones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All this I have heard and believe,\" said the white man, observing that\n",
      "the Indian paused: \"but it was long before the English came into the\n",
      "country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A pine grew then where this chestnut now stands. The first pale-faces\n",
      "who came among us spoke no English. They came in a large canoe, when my\n",
      "fathers had buried the tomahawk with the redmen around them. Then,\n",
      "Hawkeye,\" he continued, betraying his deep emotion only by permitting\n",
      "his voice to fall to those low, guttural tones, which rendered his\n",
      "language, as spoken at times, so very musical; \"then, Hawkeye, we were\n",
      "one people, and we were happy. The salt lake gave us its fish, the wood\n",
      "its deer, and the air its birds. We took wives who bore us children; we\n",
      "worshipped the Great Spirit; and we kept the Maquas beyond the sound of\n",
      "our songs of triumph!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know you anything of your own family at that time?\" demanded the white.\n",
      "\"But you are a just man, for an Indian! and, as I suppose you hold their\n",
      "gifts, your fathers must have been brave warriors, and wise men at the\n",
      "council fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My tribe is the grandfather of nations, but I am an unmixed man. The\n",
      "blood of chiefs is in my veins, where it must stay forever. The Dutch\n",
      "landed, and gave my people the fire-water; they drank until the heavens\n",
      "and the earth seemed to meet, and they foolishly thought they had found\n",
      "the Great Spirit. Then they parted with their land. Foot by foot, they\n",
      "were driven back from the shores, until I, that am a chief and a\n",
      "sagamore, have never seen the sun shine but through the trees, and have\n",
      "never visited the graves of, my fathers!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Graves bring solemn feelings over the mind,\" returned the scout, a good\n",
      "deal touched at the calm suffering of his companion; \"and they often aid\n",
      "a man in his good intentions; though, for myself, I expect to leave my\n",
      "own bones unburied, to bleach in the woods, or to be torn asunder by the\n",
      "wolves. But where are to be found those of your race who came to their\n",
      "kin in the Delaware country, so many summers since?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are the blossoms of those summers!--fallen, one by one: so all of\n",
      "my family departed, each in his turn, to the land of spirits. I am on\n",
      "the hill-top, and must go down into the valley; and when Uncas follows\n",
      "in my footsteps, there will no longer be any of the blood of the\n",
      "sagamores, for my boy is the last of the Mohicans.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncas is here!\" said another voice, in the same soft, guttural tones,\n",
      "near his elbow; \"who speaks to Uncas?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The white man loosened his knife in his leathern sheath, and made an\n",
      "involuntary movement of the hand towards his rifle, at this sudden\n",
      "interruption; but the Indian sat composed, and without turning his head\n",
      "at the unexpected sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the next instant, a youthful warrior passed between them, with a\n",
      "noiseless step, and seated himself on the bank of the rapid stream. No\n",
      "exclamation of surprise escaped the father, nor was any question asked,\n",
      "or reply given, for several minutes; each appearing to await the moment\n",
      "when he might speak, without betraying womanish curiosity or childish\n",
      "impatience. The white man seemed to take counsel from their customs,\n",
      "and, relinquishing his grasp of the rifle, he also remained silent and\n",
      "reserved. At length Chingachgook turned his eyes slowly towards his son,\n",
      "and demanded,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do the Maquas dare to leave the print of their moccasins in these\n",
      "woods?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been on their trail,\" replied the young Indian, \"and know that\n",
      "they number as many as the fingers of my two hands; but they lie hid,\n",
      "like cowards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The thieves are outlying for scalps and plunder!\" said the white man,\n",
      "whom we shall call Hawkeye, after the manner of his companions. \"That\n",
      "bushy Frenchman, Montcalm, will send his spies into our very camp, but\n",
      "he will know what road we travel!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tis enough!\" returned the father, glancing his eye towards the setting\n",
      "sun; \"they shall be driven like deer from their bushes. Hawkeye, let us\n",
      "eat to-night, and show the Maquas that we are men to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am as ready to do the one as the other; but to fight the Iroquois\n",
      "'tis necessary to find the skulkers; and to eat, 'tis necessary to get\n",
      "the game--talk of the devil and he will come; there is a pair of the\n",
      "biggest antlers I have seen this season, moving the bushes below the\n",
      "hill! Now, Uncas,\" he continued in a half whisper, and laughing with a\n",
      "kind of inward sound, like one who had learnt to be watchful, \"I will\n",
      "bet my charger three times full of powder, against a foot of wampum,\n",
      "that I take him atwixt the eyes, and nearer to the right than to the\n",
      "left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It cannot be!\" said the young Indian, springing to his feet with\n",
      "youthful eagerness; \"all but the tips of his horns are hid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a boy!\" said the white man, shaking his head while he spoke, and\n",
      "addressing the father. \"Does he think when a hunter sees a part of the\n",
      "creatur', he can't tell where the rest of him should be!\"\n",

      "into the bushes, and the wounded buck plunged from the cover, to the\n",
      "very feet of his hidden enemy. Avoiding the horns of the infuriated\n",
      "animal, Uncas darted to his side, and passed his knife across the\n",
      "throat, when bounding to the edge of the river it fell, dyeing the\n",
