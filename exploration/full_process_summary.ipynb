      "text/plain": "['\\n  \"Before these fields were shorn and tilled,\\n    Full to the brim our rivers flowed;\\n  The melody of waters filled\\n    The fresh and boundless wood;\\n  And torrents dashed, and rivulets played,\\n    And fountains spouted in the shade.\"\\n\\n  BRYANT.\\n\\n\\nLeaving the unsuspecting Heyward and his confiding companions to\\npenetrate still deeper into a forest that contained such treacherous\\ninmates, we must use an author\\'s privilege, and shift the scene a few\\nmiles to the westward of the place where we have last seen them.\\n\\nOn that day, two men were lingering on the banks of a small but rapid\\nstream, within an hour\\'s journey of the encampment of Webb, like those\\nwho awaited the appearance of an absent person, or the approach of some\\nexpected event. The vast canopy of woods spread itself to the margin of\\nthe river overhanging the water, and shadowing its dark current with a\\ndeeper hue. The rays of the sun were beginning to grow less fierce, and\\nthe intense heat of the day was lessened, as the cooler vapors of the\\nsprings and fountains rose above their leafy beds, and rested in the\\natmosphere. Still that breathing silence, which marks the drowsy\\nsultriness of an American landscape in July, pervaded the secluded spot,\\ninterrupted only by the low voices of the men, the occasional and lazy\\ntap of a woodpecker, the discordant cry of some gaudy jay, or a swelling\\non the ear, from the dull roar of a distant waterfall.\\n\\nThese feeble and broken sounds were, however, too familiar to the\\nforesters, to draw their attention from the more interesting matter of\\ntheir dialogue. While one of these loiterers showed the red skin and\\nwild accoutrements of a native of the woods, the other exhibited,\\nthrough the mask of his rude and nearly savage equipments, the brighter,\\nthough sunburnt and long-faded complexion of one who might claim descent\\nfrom a European parentage. The former was seated on the end of a mossy\\nlog, in a posture that permitted him to heighten the effect of his\\nearnest language, by the calm but expressive gestures of an Indian\\nengaged in debate. His body, which was nearly naked, presented a\\nterrific emblem of death, drawn in intermingled colors of white and\\nblack. His closely shaved head, on which no other hair than the well\\nknown and chivalrous scalping tuft[5] was preserved, was without\\nornament of any kind, with the exception of a solitary eagle\\'s plume,\\nthat crossed his crown, and depended over the left shoulder. A tomahawk\\nand scalping-knife, of English manufacture, were in his girdle; while a\\nshort military rifle, of that sort with which the policy of the whites\\narmed their savage allies, lay carelessly across his bare and sinewy\\nknee. The expanded chest, full formed limbs, and grave countenance of\\nthis warrior, would denote that he had reached the vigor of his days,\\nthough no symptoms of decay appeared to have yet weakened his manhood.\\n\\nThe frame of the white man, judging by such parts as were not concealed\\nby his clothes, was like that of one who had known hardships and\\nexertion from his earliest youth. His person, though muscular, was\\nrather attenuated than full; but every nerve and muscle appeared strung\\nand indurated by unremitted exposure and toil. He wore a hunting-shirt\\nof forest green, fringed with faded yellow[6], and a summer cap of skins\\nwhich had been shorn of their fur. He also bore a knife in a girdle of\\nwampum, like that which confined the scanty garments of the Indian, but\\nno tomahawk. His moccasins were ornamented after the gay fashion of the\\nnatives, while the only part of his under-dress which appeared below the\\nhunting-frock, was a pair of buckskin leggings, that laced at the sides,\\nand which were gartered above the knees with the sinews of a deer. A\\npouch and horn completed his personal accoutrements, though a rifle of\\ngreat length[7], which the theory of the more ingenious whites had\\ntaught them was the most dangerous of all fire-arms, leaned against a\\nneighboring sapling. The eye of the hunter, or scout, whichever he might\\nbe, was small, quick, keen, and restless, roving while he spoke, on\\nevery side of him, as if in quest of game, or distrusting the sudden\\napproach of some lurking enemy. Notwithstanding the symptoms of habitual\\nsuspicion, his countenance was not only without guile, but at the moment\\nat which he is introduced, it was charged with an expression of sturdy\\nhonesty.\\n\\n\"Even your traditions make the case in my favor, Chingachgook,\" he said,\\nspeaking in the tongue which was known to all the natives who formerly\\ninhabited the country between the Hudson and the Potomac, and of which\\nwe shall give a free translation for the benefit of the reader;\\nendeavoring, at the same time, to preserve some of the peculiarities,\\nboth of the individual and of the language. \"Your fathers came from the\\nsetting sun, crossed the big river,[8] fought the people of the country,\\nand took the land; and mine came from the red sky of the morning, over\\nthe salt lake, and did their work much after the fashion that had been\\nset them by yours; then let God judge the matter between us, and friends\\nspare their words!\"\\n\\n\"My fathers fought with the naked redmen!\" returned the Indian sternly,\\nin the same language. \"Is there no difference, Hawkeye, between the\\nstone-headed arrow of the warrior, and the leaden bullet with which you\\nkill?\"\\n\\n\"There is reason in an Indian, though nature has made him with a red\\nskin!\" said the white man, shaking his head like one on whom such an\\nappeal to his justice was not thrown away. For a moment he appeared to\\nbe conscious of having the worst of the argument, then, rallying again,\\nhe answered the objection of his antagonist in the best manner his\\nlimited information would allow: \"I am no scholar, and I care not who\\nknows it; but judging from what I have seen, at deer chases and squirrel\\nhunts, of the sparks below, I should think a rifle in the hands of their\\ngrandfathers was not so dangerous as a hickory bow and a good flint-head\\nmight be, if drawn with Indian judgment, and sent by an Indian eye.\"\\n\\n\"You have the story told by your fathers,\" returned the other, coldly\\nwaving his hand. \"What say your old men? do they tell the young\\nwarriors, that the pale-faces met the redmen, painted for war and armed\\nwith the stone hatchet and wooden gun?\"\\n\\n\"I am not a prejudiced man, nor one who vaunts himself on his natural\\nprivileges, though the worst enemy I have on earth, and he is an\\nIroquois, daren\\'t deny that I am genuine white,\" the scout replied,\\nsurveying, with secret satisfaction, the faded color of his bony and\\nsinewy hand; \"and I am willing to own that my people have many ways, of\\nwhich, as an honest man, I can\\'t approve. It is one of their customs to\\nwrite in books what they have done and seen, instead of telling them in\\ntheir villages, where the lie can be given to the face of a cowardly\\nboaster, and the brave soldier can call on his comrades to witness for\\nthe truth of his words. In consequence of this bad fashion, a man who is\\ntoo conscientious to misspend his days among the women, in learning the\\nnames of black marks, may never hear of the deeds of his fathers, nor\\nfeel a pride in striving to outdo them. For myself, I conclude the\\nBumppos could shoot, for I have a natural turn with a rifle, which must\\nhave been handed down from generation to generation, as, our holy\\ncommandments tell us, all good and evil gifts are bestowed; though I\\nshould be loth to answer for other people in such a matter. But every\\nstory has its two sides; so I ask you, Chingachgook, what passed,\\naccording to the traditions of the redmen, when our fathers first met?\"\\n\\nA silence of a minute succeeded, during which the Indian sat mute; then,\\nfull of the dignity of his office, he commenced his brief tale, with a\\nsolemnity that served to heighten its appearance of truth.\\n\\n\"Listen, Hawkeye, and your ear shall drink no lie. \\'Tis what my fathers\\nhave said, and what the Mohicans have done.\" He hesitated a single\\ninstant, and bending a cautious glance toward his companion, he\\ncontinued, in a manner that was divided between interrogation and\\nassertion, \"Does not this stream at our feet run towards the summer,\\nuntil its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?\"\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be denied that your traditions tell you true in both these\\nmatters,\" said the white man; \"for I have been there, and have seen\\nthem; though, why water, which is so sweet in the shade, should become\\nbitter in the sun, is an alteration for which I have never been able to\\naccount.\"\\n\\n\"And the current!\" demanded the Indian, who expected his reply with that\\nsort of interest that a man feels in the confirmation of testimony, at\\nwhich he marvels even while he respects it; \"the fathers of Chingachgook\\nhave not lied!\"\\n\\n\"The Holy Bible is not more true, and that is the truest thing in\\nnature. They call this up-stream current the tide, which is a thing soon\\nexplained, and clear enough. Six hours the waters run in, and six hours\\nthey run out, and the reason is this: when there is higher water in the\\nsea than in the river, they run in, until the river gets to be highest,\\nand then it runs out again.\"\\n\\n\"The waters in the woods, and on the great lakes, run downward until\\nthey lie like my hand,\" said the Indian, stretching the limb\\nhorizontally before him, \"and then they run no more.\"\\n\\n\"No honest man will deny it,\" said the scout, a little nettled at the\\nimplied distrust of his explanation of the mystery of the tides; \"and I\\ngrant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level.\\nBut everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the\\nsmall scale, the \\'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In\\nthis manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may\\nbe stagnant, as you and I both know they are, having seen them; but when\\nyou come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the\\nearth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well\\nexpect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile\\nabove us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at\\nthis very moment!\"\\n\\nIf unsatisfied by the philosophy of his companion, the Indian was far\\ntoo dignified to betray his unbelief. He listened like one who was\\nconvinced, and resumed his narrative in his former solemn manner.\\n\\n\"We came from the place where the sun is hid at night, over great plains\\nwhere the buffaloes live, until we reached the big river. There we\\nfought the Alligewi, till the ground was red with their blood. From the\\nbanks of the big river to the shores of the salt lake, there was none to\\nmeet us. The Maquas followed at a distance. We said the country should\\nbe ours from the place where the water runs up no longer on this stream,\\nto a river twenty suns\\' journey toward the summer. The land we had taken\\nlike warriors, we kept like men. We drove the Maquas into the woods with\\nthe bears. They only tasted salt at the licks; they drew no fish from\\nthe great lake; we threw them the bones.\"\\n\\n\"All this I have heard and believe,\" said the white man, observing that\\nthe Indian paused: \"but it was long before the English came into the\\ncountry.\"\\n\\n\"A pine grew then where this chestnut now stands. The first pale-faces\\nwho came among us spoke no English. They came in a large canoe, when my\\nfathers had buried the tomahawk with the redmen around them. Then,\\nHawkeye,\" he continued, betraying his deep emotion only by permitting\\nhis voice to fall to those low, guttural tones, which rendered his\\nlanguage, as spoken at times, so very musical; \"then, Hawkeye, we were\\none people, and we were happy. The salt lake gave us its fish, the wood\\nits deer, and the air its birds. We took wives who bore us children; we\\nworshipped the Great Spirit; and we kept the Maquas beyond the sound of\\nour songs of triumph!\"\\n\\n\"Know you anything of your own family at that time?\" demanded the white.\\n\"But you are a just man, for an Indian! and, as I suppose you hold their\\ngifts, your fathers must have been brave warriors, and wise men at the\\ncouncil fire.\"\\n\\n\"My tribe is the grandfather of nations, but I am an unmixed man. The\\nblood of chiefs is in my veins, where it must stay forever. The Dutch\\nlanded, and gave my people the fire-water; they drank until the heavens\\nand the earth seemed to meet, and they foolishly thought they had found\\nthe Great Spirit. Then they parted with their land. Foot by foot, they\\nwere driven back from the shores, until I, that am a chief and a\\nsagamore, have never seen the sun shine but through the trees, and have\\nnever visited the graves of, my fathers!\"\\n\\n\"Graves bring solemn feelings over the mind,\" returned the scout, a good\\ndeal touched at the calm suffering of his companion; \"and they often aid\\na man in his good intentions; though, for myself, I expect to leave my\\nown bones unburied, to bleach in the woods, or to be torn asunder by the\\nwolves. But where are to be found those of your race who came to their\\nkin in the Delaware country, so many summers since?\"\\n\\n\"Where are the blossoms of those summers!--fallen, one by one: so all of\\nmy family departed, each in his turn, to the land of spirits. I am on\\nthe hill-top, and must go down into the valley; and when Uncas follows\\nin my footsteps, there will no longer be any of the blood of the\\nsagamores, for my boy is the last of the Mohicans.\"\\n\\n\"Uncas is here!\" said another voice, in the same soft, guttural tones,\\nnear his elbow; \"who speaks to Uncas?\"\\n\\nThe white man loosened his knife in his leathern sheath, and made an\\ninvoluntary movement of the hand towards his rifle, at this sudden\\ninterruption; but the Indian sat composed, and without turning his head\\nat the unexpected sounds.\\n\\nAt the next instant, a youthful warrior passed between them, with a\\nnoiseless step, and seated himself on the bank of the rapid stream. No\\nexclamation of surprise escaped the father, nor was any question asked,\\nor reply given, for several minutes; each appearing to await the moment\\nwhen he might speak, without betraying womanish curiosity or childish\\nimpatience. The white man seemed to take counsel from their customs,\\nand, relinquishing his grasp of the rifle, he also remained silent and\\nreserved. At length Chingachgook turned his eyes slowly towards his son,\\nand demanded,--\\n\\n\"Do the Maquas dare to leave the print of their moccasins in these\\nwoods?\"\\n\\n\"I have been on their trail,\" replied the young Indian, \"and know that\\nthey number as many as the fingers of my two hands; but they lie hid,\\nlike cowards.\"\\n\\n\"The thieves are outlying for scalps and plunder!\" said the white man,\\nwhom we shall call Hawkeye, after the manner of his companions. \"That\\nbushy Frenchman, Montcalm, will send his spies into our very camp, but\\nhe will know what road we travel!\"\\n\\n\"Tis enough!\" returned the father, glancing his eye towards the setting\\nsun; \"they shall be driven like deer from their bushes. Hawkeye, let us\\neat to-night, and show the Maquas that we are men to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I am as ready to do the one as the other; but to fight the Iroquois\\n\\'tis necessary to find the skulkers; and to eat, \\'tis necessary to get\\nthe game--talk of the devil and he will come; there is a pair of the\\nbiggest antlers I have seen this season, moving the bushes below the\\nhill! Now, Uncas,\" he continued in a half whisper, and laughing with a\\nkind of inward sound, like one who had learnt to be watchful, \"I will\\nbet my charger three times full of powder, against a foot of wampum,\\nthat I take him atwixt the eyes, and nearer to the right than to the\\nleft.\"\\n\\n\"It cannot be!\" said the young Indian, springing to his feet with\\nyouthful eagerness; \"all but the tips of his horns are hid!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a boy!\" said the white man, shaking his head while he spoke, and\\naddressing the father. \"Does he think when a hunter sees a part of the\\ncreatur\\', he can\\'t tell where the rest of him should be!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nUNCAS SLAYS A DEER\\n\\n_Avoiding the horns of the infuriated animal, Uncas darted to his side,\\nand passed his knife across the throat_]\\n\\nAdjusting his rifle, he was about to make an exhibition of that skill,\\non which he so much valued himself, when the warrior struck up the piece\\nwith his hand, saying--\\n\\n\"Hawkeye! will you fight the Maquas?\"\\n\\n\"These Indians know the nature of the woods, as it might be by\\ninstinct!\" returned the scout, dropping his rifle, and turning away like\\na man who was convinced of his error. \"I must leave the buck to your\\narrow, Uncas, or we may kill a deer for them thieves, the Iroquois, to\\neat.\"\\n\\nThe instant the father seconded this intimation by an expressive gesture\\nof the hand, Uncas threw himself on the ground, and approached the\\nanimal with wary movements. When within a few yards of the cover, he\\nfitted an arrow to his bow with the utmost care, while the antlers\\nmoved, as if their owner snuffed an enemy in the tainted air. In another\\nmoment the twang of the cord was heard, a white streak was seen glancing\\ninto the bushes, and the wounded buck plunged from the cover, to the\\nvery feet of his hidden enemy. Avoiding the horns of the infuriated\\nanimal, Uncas darted to his side, and passed his knife across the\\nthroat, when bounding to the edge of the river it fell, dyeing the\\nwaters with its blood.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas done with Indian skill,\" said the scout, laughing inwardly, but\\nwith vast satisfaction; \"and \\'twas a pretty sight to behold! Though an\\narrow is a near shot, and needs a knife to finish the work.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" ejaculated his companion, turning quickly, like a hound who\\nscented game.\\n\\n\"By the Lord, there is a drove of them!\" exclaimed the scout, whose eyes\\nbegan to glisten with the ardor of his usual occupation; \"if they come\\nwithin range of a bullet I will drop one, though the whole Six Nations\\nshould be lurking within sound! What do you hear, Chingachgook? for to\\nmy ears the woods are dumb.\"\\n\\n\"There is but one deer, and he is dead,\" said the Indian, bending his\\nbody till his ear nearly touched the earth. \"I hear the sounds of feet!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps the wolves have driven the buck to shelter, and are following\\non his trail.\"\\n\\n\"No. The horses of white men are coming!\" returned the other, raising\\nhimself with dignity, and resuming his seat on the log with his former\\ncomposure. \"Hawkeye, they are your brothers; speak to them.\"\\n\\n\"That will I, and in English that the king needn\\'t be ashamed to\\nanswer,\" returned the hunter, speaking in the language of which he\\nboasted; \"but I see nothing, nor do I hear the sounds of man or beast;\\n\\'tis strange that an Indian should understand white sounds better than a\\nman who, his very enemies will own, has no cross in his blood, although\\nhe may have lived with the redskins long enough to be suspected! Ha!\\nthere goes something like the cracking of a dry stick, too--now I hear\\nthe bushes move--yes, yes, there is a trampling that I mistook for the\\nfalls--and--but here they come themselves; God keep them from the\\nIroquois!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n  \"Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove\\n  Till I torment thee for this injury.\"\\n\\n  _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream._\\n\\n\\nThe words were still in the mouth of the scout, when the leader of the\\nparty, whose approaching footsteps had caught the vigilant ear of the\\nIndian, came openly into view. A beaten path, such as those made by the\\nperiodical passage of the deer, wound through a little glen at no great\\ndistance, and struck the river at the point where the white man and his\\nred companions had posted themselves. Along this track the travellers,\\nwho had produced a surprise so unusual in the depths of the forest,\\nadvanced slowly towards the hunter, who was in front of his associates,\\nin readiness to receive them.\\n\\n\"Who comes?\" demanded the scout, throwing his rifle carelessly across\\nhis left arm, and keeping the forefinger of his right hand on the\\ntrigger, though he avoided all appearance of menace in the act, \"Who\\ncomes hither, among the beasts and dangers of the wilderness?\"\\n\\n\"Believers in religion, and friends to the law and to the king,\"\\nreturned he who rode foremost. \"Men who have journeyed since the rising\\nsun, in the shades of this forest, without nourishment, and are sadly\\ntired of their wayfaring.\"\\n\\n\"You are, then, lost,\" interrupted the hunter, \"and have found how\\nhelpless \\'tis not to know whether to take the right hand or the left?\"\\n\\n\"Even so; sucking babes are not more dependent on those who guide them\\nthan we who are of larger growth, and who may now be said to possess the\\nstature without the knowledge of men. Know you the distance to a post of\\nthe crown called William Henry?\"\\n\\n\"Hoot!\" shouted the scout, who did not spare his open laughter, though,\\ninstantly checking the dangerous sounds, he indulged his merriment at\\nless risk of being overheard by any lurking enemies. \"You are as much\\noff the scent as a hound would be, with Horican atwixt him and the deer!\\nWilliam Henry, man! if you are friends to the king, and have business\\nwith the army, your better way would be to follow the river down to\\nEdward, and lay the matter before Webb; who tarries there, instead of\\npushing into the defiles, and driving this saucy Frenchman back across\\nChamplain, into his den again.\"\\n\\nBefore the stranger could make any reply to this unexpected proposition,\\nanother horseman dashed the bushes aside, and leaped his charger into\\nthe pathway, in front of his companion.\\n\\n\"What, then, may be our distance from Fort Edward?\" demanded a new\\nspeaker; \"the place you advise us to seek we left this morning, and our\\ndestination is the head of the lake.\"\\n\\n\"Then you must have lost your eyesight afore losing your way, for the\\nroad across the portage is cut to a good two rods, and is as grand a\\npath, I calculate, as any that runs into London, or even before the\\npalace of the king himself.\"\\n\\n\"We will not dispute concerning the excellence of the passage,\" returned\\nHeyward, smiling; for, as the reader has anticipated, it was he. \"It is\\nenough, for the present, that we trusted to an Indian guide to take us\\nby a nearer, though blinder path, and that we are deceived in his\\nknowledge. In plain words, we know not where we are.\"\\n\\n\"An Indian lost in the woods!\" said the scout, shaking his head\\ndoubtingly; \"when the sun is scorching the tree-tops, and the\\nwater-courses are full; when the moss on every beech he sees, will tell\\nhim in which quarter the north star will shine at night! The woods are\\nfull of deer paths which run to the streams and licks, places well known\\nto everybody; nor have the geese done their flight to the Canada waters\\naltogether! \\'Tis strange that an Indian should be lost atwixt Horican\\nand the bend in the river. Is he a Mohawk?\"\\n\\n\"Not by birth, though adopted in that tribe; I think his birthplace was\\nfarther north, and he is one of those you call a Huron.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" exclaimed the two companions of the scout, who had continued,\\nuntil this part of the dialogue, seated immovable, and apparently\\nindifferent to what passed, but who now sprang to their feet with an\\nactivity and interest that had evidently got the better of their\\nreserve, by surprise.\\n\\n\"A Huron!\" repeated the sturdy scout, once more shaking his head in open\\ndistrust; \"they are a thievish race, nor do I care by whom they are\\nadopted; you can never make anything of them but skulks and vagabonds.\\nSince you trusted yourself to the care of one of that nation, I only\\nwonder that you have not fallen in with more.\"\\n\\n\"Of that there is little danger, since William Henry is so many miles in\\nour front. You forget that I have told you our guide is now a Mohawk,\\nand that he serves with our forces as a friend.\"\\n\\n\"And I tell you that he who is born a Mingo will die a Mingo,\" returned\\nthe other, positively. \"A Mohawk! No, give me a Delaware or a Mohican\\nfor honesty; and when they will fight, which they won\\'t all do, having\\nsuffered their cunning enemies, the Maquas, to make them women--but when\\nthey will fight at all, look to a Delaware, or a Mohican, for a\\nwarrior!\"\\n\\n\"Enough of this,\" said Heyward, impatiently; \"I wish not to inquire into\\nthe character of a man that I know, and to whom you must be a stranger.\\nYou have not yet answered my question: what is our distance from the\\nmain army at Edward?\"\\n\\n\"It seems that may depend on who is your guide. One would think such a\\nhorse as that might get over a good deal of ground atwixt sun-up and\\nsun-down.\"\\n\\n\"I wish no contention of idle words with you, friend,\" said Heyward,\\ncurbing his dissatisfied manner, and speaking in a more gentle voice;\\n\"if you will tell me the distance to Fort Edward, and conduct me\\nthither, your labor shall not go without its reward.\"\\n\\n\"And in so doing, how know I that I don\\'t guide an enemy, and a spy of\\nMontcalm, to the works of the army? It is not every man who can speak\\nthe English tongue that is an honest subject.\"\\n\\n\"If you serve with the troops, of whom I judge you to be a scout, you\\nshould know of such a regiment of the king as the 60th.\"\\n\\n\"The 60th! you can tell me little of the Royal Americans that I don\\'t\\nknow, though I do wear a hunting-shirt instead of a scarlet jacket.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, among the other things, you may know the name of its\\nmajor?\"\\n\\n\"Its major!\" interrupted the hunter, elevating his body like one who was\\nproud of his trust. \"If there is a man in the country who knows Major\\nEffingham, he stands before you.\"\\n\\n\"It is a corps which has many majors; the gentleman you name is the\\nsenior, but I speak of the junior of them all; he who commands the\\ncompanies in garrison at William Henry.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I have heard that a young gentleman of vast riches, from one\\nof the provinces far south, has got the place. He is over young, too, to\\nhold such rank, and to be put above men whose heads are beginning to\\nbleach; and yet they say he is a soldier in his knowledge, and a gallant\\ngentleman!\"\\n\\n\"Whatever he may be, or however he may be qualified for his rank, he now\\nspeaks to you, and of course can be no enemy to dread.\"\\n\\nThe scout regarded Heyward in surprise, and then lifting his cap, he\\nanswered, in a tone less confident than before, though still expressing\\ndoubt,--\\n\\n\"I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning, for the\\nlake shore.\"\\n\\n\"You have heard the truth; but I preferred a nearer route, trusting to\\nthe knowledge of the Indian I mentioned.\"\\n\\n\"And he deceived you, and then deserted?\"\\n\\n\"Neither, as I believe; certainly not the latter, for he is to be found\\nin the rear.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to look at the creatur\\'; if it is a true Iroquois I can\\ntell him by his knavish look, and by his paint,\" said the scout,\\nstepping past the charger of Heyward, and entering the path behind the\\nmare of the singing-master, whose foal had taken advantage of the halt\\nto exact the maternal contribution. After shoving aside the bushes, and\\nproceeding a few paces, he encountered the females, who awaited the\\nresult of the conference with anxiety, and not entirely without\\napprehension. Behind these, the runner leaned against a tree, where he\\nstood the close examination of the scout with an air unmoved, though\\nwith a look so dark and savage, that it might in itself excite fear.\\nSatisfied with his scrutiny, the hunter soon left him. As he repassed\\nthe females, he paused a moment to gaze upon their beauty, answering to\\nthe smile and nod of Alice with a look of open pleasure. Thence he went\\nto the side of the motherly animal, and spending a minute in a fruitless\\ninquiry into the character of her rider, he shook his head and returned\\nto Heyward.\\n\\n\"A Mingo is a Mingo, and God having made him so, neither the Mohawks nor\\nany other tribe can alter him,\" he said, when he had regained his former\\nposition. \"If we were alone, and you would leave that noble horse at the\\nmercy of the wolves to-night, I could show you the way to Edward,\\nmyself, within an hour, for it lies only about an hour\\'s journey hence;\\nbut with such ladies in your company \\'tis impossible!\"\\n\\n\"And why? they are fatigued, but they are quite equal to a ride of a few\\nmore miles.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a natural impossibility!\" repeated the scout; \"I wouldn\\'t walk a\\nmile in these woods after night gets into them, in company with that\\nrunner, for the best rifle in the colonies. They are full of outlying\\nIroquois, and your mongrel Mohawk knows where to find them too well, to\\nbe my companion.\"\\n\\n\"Think you so?\" said Heyward, leaning forward in the saddle, and\\ndropping his voice nearly to a whisper; \"I confess I have not been\\nwithout my own suspicions, though I have endeavored to conceal them, and\\naffected a confidence I have not always felt, on account of my\\ncompanions. It was because I suspected him that I would follow no\\nlonger; making him, as you see, follow me.\"\\n\\n\"I knew he was one of the cheats as soon as I laid eyes on him!\"\\nreturned the scout, placing a finger on his nose, in sign of caution.\\n\"The thief is leaning against the foot of the sugar sapling, that you\\ncan see over them bushes; his right leg is in a line with the bark of\\nthe tree, and,\" tapping his rifle, \"I can take him from where I stand,\\nbetween the ankle and the knee, with a single shot, putting an end to\\nhis tramping through the woods, for at least a month to come. If I\\nshould go back to him, the cunning varmint would suspect something, and\\nbe dodging through the trees like a frightened deer.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do. He may be innocent, and I dislike the act. Though, if I\\nfelt confident of his treachery--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a safe thing to calculate on the knavery of an Iroquois,\" said the\\nscout, throwing his rifle forward, by a sort of instinctive movement.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" interrupted Heyward, \"it will not do--we must think of some\\nother scheme; and yet, I have much reason to believe the rascal has\\ndeceived me.\"\\n\\nThe hunter, who had already abandoned his intention of maiming the\\nrunner, mused a moment, and then made a gesture, which instantly brought\\nhis two red companions to his side. They spoke together earnestly in the\\nDelaware language, though in an undertone; and by the gestures of the\\nwhite man, which were frequently directed towards the top of the\\nsapling, it was evident he pointed out the situation of their hidden\\nenemy. His companions were not long in comprehending his wishes, and\\nlaying aside their fire-arms, they parted, taking opposite sides of the\\npath, and burying themselves in the thicket, with such cautious\\nmovements, that their steps were inaudible.\\n\\n\"Now, go you back,\" said the hunter, speaking again to Heyward, \"and\\nhold the imp in talk; these Mohicans here will take him without breaking\\nhis paint.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Heyward, proudly, \"I will seize him myself.\"\\n\\n\"Hist! what could you do, mounted, against an Indian in the bushes?\"\\n\\n\"I will dismount.\"\\n\\n\"And, think you, when he saw one of your feet out of the stirrup, he\\nwould wait for the other to be free? Whoever comes into the woods to\\ndeal with the natives, must use Indian fashions, if he would wish to\\nprosper in his undertakings. Go, then, talk openly to the miscreant, and\\nseem to believe him the truest friend you have on \\'arth.\"\\n\\nHeyward prepared to comply, though with strong disgust at the nature of\\nthe office he was compelled to execute. Each moment, however, pressed\\nupon him a conviction of the critical situation in which he had suffered\\nhis invaluable trust to be involved through his own confidence. The sun\\nhad already disappeared, and the woods, suddenly deprived of his\\nlight,[9] were assuming a dusky hue, which keenly reminded him that the\\nhour the savage usually chose for his most barbarous and remorseless\\nacts of vengeance or hostility, was speedily drawing near. Stimulated by\\napprehension, he left the scout, who immediately entered into a loud\\nconversation with the stranger that had so unceremoniously enlisted\\nhimself in the party of travellers that morning. In passing his gentler\\ncompanions Heyward uttered a few words of encouragement, and was pleased\\nto find that, though fatigued with the exercise of the day, they\\nappeared to entertain no suspicion that their present embarrassment was\\nother than the result of accident. Giving them reason to believe he was\\nmerely employed in a consultation concerning the future route, he\\nspurred his charger, and drew the reins again, when the animal had\\ncarried him within a few yards of the place where the sullen runner\\nstill stood, leaning against the tree.\\n\\n\"You may see, Magua,\" he said, endeavoring to assume an air of freedom\\nand confidence, \"that the night is closing around us, and yet we are no\\nnearer to William Henry than when we left the encampment of Webb with\\nthe rising sun. You have missed the way, nor have I been more fortunate.\\nBut, happily we have fallen in with a hunter, he whom you hear talking\\nto the singer, that is acquainted with the deer-paths and by-ways of the\\nwoods, and who promises to lead us to a place where we may rest securely\\ntill the morning.\"\\n\\nThe Indian riveted his glowing eyes on Heyward as he asked, in his\\nimperfect English, \"Is he alone?\"\\n\\n\"Alone!\" hesitatingly answered Heyward to whom deception was too new to\\nbe assumed without embarrassment. \"O! not alone, surely, Magua, for you\\nknow that we are with him.\"\\n\\n\"Then Le Renard Subtil will go,\" returned the runner, coolly raising his\\nlittle wallet from the place where it had lain at his feet; \"and the\\npale-faces will see none but their own color.\"\\n\\n\"Go! Whom call you Le Renard?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the name his Canada fathers have given to Magua,\" returned the\\nrunner, with an air that manifested his pride at the distinction. \"Night\\nis the same as day to Le Subtil, when Munro waits for him.\"\\n\\n\"And what account will Le Renard give the chief of William Henry\\nconcerning his daughters? Will he dare to tell the hot-blooded Scotsman\\nthat his children are left without a guide, though Magua promised to be\\none?\"\\n\\n\"Though the gray head has a loud voice, and a long arm, Le Renard will\\nnot hear him, or feel him, in the woods.\"\\n\\n\"But what will the Mohawks say? They will make him petticoats, and bid\\nhim stay in the wigwam with the women, for he is no longer to be trusted\\nwith the business of a man.\"\\n\\n\"Le Subtil knows the path to the great lakes, and he can find the bones\\nof his fathers,\" was the answer of the unmoved runner.\\n\\n\"Enough, Magua,\" said Heyward; \"are we not friends? Why should there be\\nbitter words between us? Munro has promised you a gift for your services\\nwhen performed, and I shall be your debtor for another. Rest your weary\\nlimbs, then, and open your wallet to eat. We have a few moments to\\nspare; let us not waste them in talk like wrangling women. When the\\nladies are refreshed we will proceed.\"\\n\\n\"The pale-faces make themselves dogs to their women,\" muttered the\\nIndian, in his native language, \"and when they want to eat, their\\nwarriors must lay aside the tomahawk to feed their laziness.\"\\n\\n\"What say you, Renard?\"\\n\\n\"Le Subtil says it is good.\"\\n\\nThe Indian then fastened his eyes keenly on the open countenance of\\nHeyward, but meeting his glance, he turned them quickly away, and\\nseating himself deliberately on the ground, he drew forth the remnant of\\nsome former repast, and began to eat, though not without first bending\\nhis looks slowly and cautiously around him.\\n\\n\"This is well,\" continued Heyward; \"and Le Renard will have strength and\\nsight to find the path in the morning;\" he paused, for sounds like the\\nsnapping of a dried stick, and the rustling of leaves, rose from the\\nadjacent bushes, but recollecting himself instantly, he continued,--\"we\\nmust be moving before the sun is seen, or Montcalm may lie in our path,\\nand shut us out from the fortress.\"\\n\\nThe hand of Magua dropped from his mouth to his side, and though his\\neyes were fastened on the ground, his head was turned aside, his\\nnostrils expanded, and his ears seemed even to stand more erect than\\nusual, giving to him the appearance of a statue that was made to\\nrepresent intense attention.\\n\\nHeyward, who watched his movements with a vigilant eye, carelessly\\nextricated one of his feet from the stirrup, while he passed a hand\\ntowards the bear-skin covering of his holsters. Every effort to detect\\nthe point most regarded by the runner was completely frustrated by the\\ntremulous glances of his organs, which seemed not to rest a single\\ninstant on any particular object, and which, at the same time, could be\\nhardly said to move. While he hesitated how to proceed, Le Subtil\\ncautiously raised himself to his feet, though with a motion so slow and\\nguarded, that not the slightest noise was produced by the change.\\nHeyward felt it had now become incumbent on him to act. Throwing his leg\\nover the saddle, he dismounted, with a determination to advance and\\nseize his treacherous companion, trusting the result to his own manhood.\\nIn order, however, to prevent unnecessary alarm, he still preserved an\\nair of calmness and friendship.\\n\\n\"Le Renard Subtil does not eat,\" he said, using the appellation he had\\nfound most flattering to the vanity of the Indian. \"His corn is not well\\nparched, and it seems dry. Let me examine; perhaps something may be\\nfound among my own provisions that will help his appetite.\"\\n\\nMagua held out the wallet to the proffer of the other. He even suffered\\ntheir hands to meet, without betraying the least emotion, or varying his\\nriveted attitude of attention. But when he felt the fingers of Heyward\\nmoving gently along his own naked arm, he struck up the limb of the\\nyoung man, and uttering a piercing cry as he darted beneath it, plunged,\\nat a single bound, into the opposite thicket. At the next instant the\\nform of Chingachgook appeared from the bushes, looking like a spectre in\\nits paint, and glided across the path in swift pursuit. Next followed\\nthe shout of Uncas, when the woods were lighted by a sudden flash, that\\nwas accompanied by the sharp report of the hunter\\'s rifle.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n                      \"In such a night\\n  Did Thisbe fearfully o\\'ertrip the dew;\\n  And saw the lion\\'s shadow ere himself.\"\\n\\n  _Merchant of Venice._\\n\\n\\nThe suddenness of the flight of his guide, and the wild cries of the\\npursuers, caused Heyward to remain fixed, for a few moments, in inactive\\nsurprise. Then recollecting the importance of securing the fugitive, he\\ndashed aside the surrounding bushes, and pressed eagerly forward to lend\\nhis aid in the chase. Before he had, however, proceeded a hundred yards,\\nhe met the three foresters already returning from their unsuccessful\\npursuit.\\n\\n\"Why so soon disheartened!\" he exclaimed; \"the scoundrel must be\\nconcealed behind some of these trees, and may yet be secured. We are not\\nsafe while he goes at large.\"\\n\\n\"Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?\" returned the disappointed\\nscout; \"I heard the imp, brushing over the dry leaves, like a black\\nsnake, and blinking a glimpse of him, just over ag\\'in yon big pine, I\\npulled as it might be on the scent; but \\'twouldn\\'t do! and yet for a\\nreasoning aim, if anybody but myself had touched the trigger, I should\\ncall it a quick sight; and I may be accounted to have experience in\\nthese matters, and one who ought to know. Look at this sumach; its\\nleaves are red, though everybody knows the fruit is in the yellow\\nblossom, in the month of July!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the blood of Le Subtil! he is hurt, and may yet fall!\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" returned the scout, in decided disapprobation of this opinion,\\n\"I rubbed the bark off a limb, perhaps, but the creature leaped the\\nlonger for it. A rifle-bullet acts on a running animal, when it barks\\nhim, much the same as one of your spurs on a horse; that is, it quickens\\nmotion, and puts life into the flesh, instead of taking it away. But\\nwhen it cuts the ragged hole, after a bound or two, there is, commonly,\\na stagnation of further leaping, be it Indian or be it deer!\"\\n\\n\"We are four able bodies, to one wounded man!\"\\n\\n\"Is life grievous to you?\" interrupted the scout. \"Yonder red devils\\nwould draw you within swing of the tomahawks of his comrades, before you\\nwere heated in the chase. It was an unthoughtful act in a man who has so\\noften slept with the war-whoop ringing in the air, to let off his piece\\nwithin sound of an ambushment! But then it was a natural temptation!\\n\\'twas very natural! Come, friends, let us move our station, and in such\\na fashion, too, as will throw the cunning of a Mingo on a wrong scent,\\nor our scalps will be drying in the wind in front of Montcalm\\'s marquee,\\nag\\'in this hour to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThis appalling declaration, which the scout uttered with the cool\\nassurance of a man who fully comprehended, while he did not fear to face\\nthe danger, served to remind Heyward of the importance of the charge\\nwith which he himself had been intrusted. Glancing his eyes around, with\\na vain effort to pierce the gloom that was thickening beneath the leafy\\narches of the forest, he felt as if, cut off from human aid, his\\nunresisting companions would soon lie at the entire mercy of those\\nbarbarous enemies, who, like beasts of prey, only waited till the\\ngathering darkness might render their blows more fatally certain. His\\nawakened imagination, deluded by the deceptive light, converted each\\nwaving bush, or the fragment of some fallen tree, into human forms, and\\ntwenty times he fancied he could distinguish the horrid visages of his\\nlurking foes, peering from their hiding-places, in never-ceasing\\nwatchfulness of the movements of his party. Looking upward, he found\\nthat the thin fleecy clouds, which evening had painted on the blue sky,\\nwere already losing their faintest tints of rose-color, while the\\nimbedded stream, which glided past the spot where he stood, was to be\\ntraced only by the dark boundary of its wooded banks.\\n\\n\"What is to be done?\" he said, feeling the utter helplessness of doubt\\nin such a pressing strait; \"desert me not, for God\\'s sake! remain to\\ndefend those I escort, and freely name your own reward!\"\\n\\nHis companions, who conversed apart in the language of their tribe,\\nheeded not this sudden and earnest appeal. Though their dialogue was\\nmaintained in low and cautious sounds, but little above a whisper,\\nHeyward, who now approached, could easily distinguish the earnest tones\\nof the younger warrior from the more deliberate speeches of his seniors.\\nIt was evident that they debated on the propriety of some measure that\\nnearly concerned the welfare of the travellers. Yielding to his\\npowerful interest in the subject, and impatient of a delay that seemed\\nfraught with so much additional danger, Heyward drew still nigher to the\\ndusky group, with an intention of making his offers of compensation more\\ndefinite, when the white man, motioning, with his hand, as if he\\nconceded the disputed point, turned away, saying in a sort of soliloquy,\\nand in the English tongue,--\\n\\n\"Uncas is right! it would not be the act of men to leave such harmless\\nthings to their fate, even though it breaks up the harboring place\\nforever. If you would save these tender blossoms from the fangs of the\\nworst of serpents, gentleman, you have neither time to lose nor\\nresolution to throw away!\"\\n\\n\"How can such a wish be doubted! have I not already offered--\"\\n\\n\"Offer your prayers to Him who can give us wisdom to circumvent the\\ncunning of the devils who fill these woods,\" calmly interrupted the\\nscout, \"but spare your offers of money, which neither you may live to\\nrealize, nor I to profit by. These Mohicans and I will do what man\\'s\\nthoughts can invent, to keep such flowers, which, though so sweet, were\\nnever made for the wilderness, from harm, and that without hope of any\\nother recompense but such as God always gives to upright dealings.\\nFirst, you must promise two things, both in your own name and for your\\nfriends, or without serving you, we shall only injure ourselves!\"\\n\\n\"Name them.\"\\n\\n\"The one is, to be still as these sleeping woods, let what will happen;\\nand the other is, to keep the place where we shall take you, forever a\\nsecret from all mortal men.\"\\n\\n\"I will do my utmost to see both these conditions fulfilled.\"\\n\\n\"Then follow, for we are losing moments that are as precious as the\\nheart\\'s blood to a stricken deer!\"\\n\\nHeyward could distinguish the impatient gesture of the scout, through\\nthe increasing shadows of the evening, and he moved in his footsteps,\\nswiftly, towards the place where he had left the remainder of his party.\\nWhen they rejoined the expecting and anxious females, he briefly\\nacquainted them with the conditions of their new guide, and with the\\nnecessity that existed for their hushing every apprehension, in instant\\nand serious exertions. Although his alarming communication was not\\nreceived without much secret terror by the listeners, his earnest and\\nimpressive manner, aided perhaps by the nature of the danger, succeeded\\nin bracing their nerves to undergo some unlooked-for and unusual trial.\\nSilently, and without a moment\\'s delay, they permitted him to assist\\nthem from their saddles, when they descended quickly to the water\\'s\\nedge, where the scout had collected the rest of the party, more by the\\nagency of expressive gestures than by any use of words.\\n\\n\"What to do with these dumb creatures!\" muttered the white man, on whom\\nthe sole control of their future movements appeared to devolve; \"it\\nwould be time lost to cut their throats, and cast them into the river;\\nand to leave them here, would be to tell the Mingos that they have not\\nfar to seek to find their owners!\"\\n\\n\"Then give them their bridles, and let them range the woods,\" Heyward\\nventured to suggest.\\n\\n\"No; it would be better to mislead the imps, and make them believe they\\nmust equal a horse\\'s speed to run down their chase. Ay, ay, that will\\nblind their fire-balls of eyes! Chingach--Hist? what stirs the bush?\"\\n\\n\"The colt.\"\\n\\n\"That colt, at least, must die,\" muttered the scout, grasping the mane\\nof the nimble beast, which easily eluded his hand; \"Uncas, your arrows!\"\\n\\n\"Hold!\" exclaimed the proprietor of the condemned animal, aloud, without\\nregard to the whispering tones used by the others; \"spare the foal of\\nMiriam! it is the comely offspring of a faithful dam, and would\\nwillingly injure naught.\"\\n\\n\"When men struggle for the single life God has given them,\" said the\\nscout sternly, \"even their own kind seem no more than the beasts of the\\nwood. If you speak again, I shall leave you to the mercy of the Maquas!\\nDraw to your arrow\\'s head, Uncas; we have no time for second blows.\"\\n\\nThe low, muttering sounds of his threatening voice were still audible,\\nwhen the wounded foal, first rearing on its hinder legs, plunged forward\\nto its knees. It was met by Chingachgook, whose knife passed across its\\nthroat quicker than thought, and then precipitating the motions of the\\nstruggling victim, he dashed it into the river, down whose stream it\\nglided away, gasping audibly for breath with its ebbing life. This deed\\nof apparent cruelty, but of real necessity, fell upon the spirits of the\\ntravellers like a terrific warning of the peril in which they stood,\\nheightened as it was by the calm though steady resolution of the actors\\nin the scene. The sisters shuddered and clung closer to each other,\\nwhile Heyward instinctively laid his hand on one of the pistols he had\\njust drawn from their holsters, as he placed himself between his charge\\nand those dense shadows that seemed to draw an impenetrable veil before\\nthe bosom of the forest.\\n\\nThe Indians, however, hesitated not a moment, but taking the bridles,\\nthey led the frightened and reluctant horses into the bed of the river.\\n\\nAt a short distance from the shore they turned, and were soon concealed\\nby the projection of the bank, under the brow of which they moved, in a\\ndirection opposite to the course of the waters. In the meantime, the\\nscout drew a canoe of bark from its place of concealment beneath some\\nlow bushes, whose branches were waving with the eddies of the current,\\ninto which he silently motioned for the females to enter. They complied\\nwithout hesitation, though many a fearful and anxious glance was thrown\\nbehind them towards the thickening gloom which now lay like a dark\\nbarrier along the margin of the stream.\\n\\nSo soon as Cora and Alice were seated, the scout, without regarding the\\nelement, directed Heyward to support one side of the frail vessel, and\\nposting himself at the other, they bore it up against the stream,\\nfollowed by the dejected owner of the dead foal. In this manner they\\nproceeded, for many rods, in a silence that was only interrupted by the\\nrippling of the water, as its eddies played around them, or the low dash\\nmade by their own cautious footsteps. Heyward yielded the guidance of\\nthe canoe implicitly to the scout, who approached or receded from the\\nshore, to avoid the fragments of rocks, or deeper parts of the river,\\nwith a readiness that showed his knowledge of the route they held.\\nOccasionally he would stop; and in the midst of a breathing stillness,\\nthat the dull but increasing roar of the waterfall only served to render\\nmore impressive, he would listen with painful intenseness, to catch any\\nsounds that might arise from the slumbering forest. When assured that\\nall was still, and unable to detect, even by the aid of his practised\\nsenses, any sign of his approaching foes, he would deliberately resume\\nhis slow and unguarded progress. At length they reached a point in the\\nriver, where the roving eye of Heyward became riveted on a cluster of\\nblack objects, collected at a spot where the high bank threw a deeper\\nshadow than usual on the dark waters. Hesitating to advance, he pointed\\nout the place to the attention of his companion.\\n\\n\"Ay,\" returned the composed scout, \"the Indians have hid the beasts\\nwith the judgment of natives! Water leaves no trail, and an owl\\'s eyes\\nwould be blinded by the darkness of such a hole.\"\\n\\nThe whole party was soon reunited, and another consultation was held\\nbetween the scout and his new comrades, during which, they whose fates\\ndepended on the faith and ingenuity of these unknown foresters, had a\\nlittle leisure to observe their situation more minutely.\\n\\nThe river was confined between high and cragged rocks, one of which\\nimpended above the spot where the canoe rested. As these, again, were\\nsurmounted by tall trees, which appeared to totter on the brows of the\\nprecipice, it gave the stream the appearance of running through a deep\\nand narrow dell. All beneath the fantastic limbs and ragged tree-tops,\\nwhich were, here and there, dimly painted against the starry zenith, lay\\nalike in shadowed obscurity. Behind them, the curvature of the banks\\nsoon bounded the view, by the same dark and wooded outline; but in\\nfront, and apparently at no great distance, the water seemed piled\\nagainst the heavens, whence it tumbled into caverns, out of which issued\\nthose sullen sounds that had loaded the evening atmosphere. It seemed,\\nin truth, to be a spot devoted to seclusion, and the sisters imbibed a\\nsoothing impression of security, as they gazed upon its romantic, though\\nnot unappalling beauties. A general movement among their conductors,\\nhowever, soon recalled them from a contemplation of the wild charms that\\nnight had assisted to lend the place, to a painful sense of their real\\nperil.\\n\\nThe horses had been secured to some scattered shrubs that grew in the\\nfissures of the rocks, where, standing in the water, they were left to\\npass the night. The scout directed Heyward and his disconsolate\\nfellow-travellers to seat themselves in the forward end of the canoe,\\nand took possession of the other himself, as erect and steady as if he\\nfloated in a vessel of much firmer materials. The Indians warily\\nretraced their steps towards the place they had left, when the scout,\\nplacing his pole against a rock, by a powerful shove, sent his frail\\nbark directly into the centre of the turbulent stream. For many minutes\\nthe struggle between the light bubble in which they floated, and the\\nswift current, was severe and doubtful. Forbidden to stir even a hand,\\nand almost afraid to breathe, lest they should expose the frail fabric\\nto the fury of the stream, the passengers watched the glancing waters in\\nfeverish suspense. Twenty times they thought the whirling eddies were\\nsweeping them to destruction, when the master-hand of their pilot would\\nbring the bows of the canoe to stem the rapid. A long, a vigorous, and,\\nas it appeared to the females, a desperate effort, closed the struggle.\\nJust as Alice veiled her eyes in horror, under the impression that they\\nwere about to be swept within the vortex at the foot of the cataract,\\nthe canoe floated, stationary, at the side of a flat rock, that lay on a\\nlevel with the water.\\n\\n\"Where are we? and what is next to be done?\" demanded Heyward,\\nperceiving that the exertions of the scout had ceased.\\n\\n\"You are at the foot of Glenn\\'s,\" returned the other, speaking aloud,\\nwithout fear of consequences, within the roar of the cataract; \"and the\\nnext thing is to make a steady landing, lest the canoe upset, and you\\nshould go down again the hard road we have travelled, faster than you\\ncame up; \\'tis a hard rift to stem, when the river is a little swelled;\\nand five is an unnatural number to keep dry, in the hurry-skurry, with a\\nlittle birchen bark and gum. There, go you all on the rock, and I will\\nbring up the Mohicans with the venison. A man had better sleep without\\nhis scalp, than famish in the midst of plenty.\"\\n\\nHis passengers gladly complied with these directions. As the last foot\\ntouched the rock, the canoe whirled from its station, when the tall form\\nof the scout was seen, for an instant, gliding above the waters, before\\nit disappeared in the impenetrable darkness that rested on the bed of\\nthe river. Left by their guide, the travellers remained a few minutes in\\nhelpless ignorance, afraid even to move along the broken rocks, lest a\\nfalse step should precipitate them down some one of the many deep and\\nroaring caverns, into which the water seemed to tumble, on every side of\\nthem. Their suspense, however, was soon relieved; for aided by the skill\\nof the natives, the canoe shot back into the eddy, and floated again at\\nthe side of the low rock before they thought the scout had even time to\\nrejoin his companions.\\n\\n\"We are now fortified, garrisoned, and provisioned,\" cried Heyward,\\ncheerfully, \"and may set Montcalm and his allies at defiance. How, now,\\nmy vigilant sentinel, can you see anything of those you call the\\nIroquois, on the mainland?\"\\n\\n\"I call them Iroquois, because to me every native, who speaks a foreign\\ntongue, is accounted an enemy, though he may pretend to serve the king!\\nIf Webb wants faith and honesty in an Indian, let him bring out the\\ntribes of the Delawares, and send these greedy and lying Mohawks and\\nOneidas, with their six nations of varlets, where in nature they belong,\\namong the French!\"\\n\\n\"We should then exchange a warlike for a useless friend! I have heard\\nthat the Delawares have laid aside the hatchet, and are content to be\\ncalled women!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, shame on the Hollanders[10] and Iroquois, who circumvented them by\\ntheir deviltries, into such a treaty! But I have known them for twenty\\nyears, and I call him liar, that says cowardly blood runs in the veins\\nof a Delaware. You have driven their tribes from the sea-shore, and\\nwould now believe what their enemies say, that you may sleep at night\\nupon an easy pillow. No, no; to me, every Indian who speaks a foreign\\ntongue is an Iroquois, whether the castle[11] of his tribe be in Canada,\\nor be in New York.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that the stubborn adherence of the scout to the\\ncause of his friends the Delawares or Mohicans, for they were branches\\nof the same numerous people, was likely to prolong a useless discussion,\\nchanged the subject.\\n\\n\"Treaty or no treaty, I know full well, that your two companions are\\nbrave and cautious warriors! have they heard or seen anything of our\\nenemies?\"\\n\\n\"An Indian is a mortal to be felt afore he is seen,\" returned the scout,\\nascending the rock, and throwing the deer carelessly down. \"I trust to\\nother signs than such as come in at the eye, when I am outlying on the\\ntrail of the Mingos.\"\\n\\n\"Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry to think they had, though this is a spot that stout\\ncourage might hold for a smart skrimmage. I will not deny, however, but\\nthe horses cowered when I passed them, as though they scented the\\nwolves; and a wolf is a beast that is apt to hover about an Indian\\nambushment, craving the offals of the deer the savages kill.\"\\n\\n\"You forget the buck at your feet! or, may we not owe their visit to the\\ndead colt? Ha! what noise is that?\"\\n\\n\"Poor Miriam!\" murmured the stranger; \"thy foal was foreordained to\\nbecome a prey to ravenous beasts!\" Then, suddenly lifting up his voice,\\namid the eternal din of the waters, he sang aloud,--\\n\\n  \"First born of Egypt, smite did He,\\n  Of mankind, and of beast also;\\n  O, Egypt! wonders sent \\'midst thee,\\n  On Pharaoh and his servants too!\"\\n\\n\"The death of the colt sits heavy on the heart of its owner,\" said the\\nscout; \"but it\\'s a good sign to see a man account upon his dumb friends.\\nHe has the religion of the matter, in believing what is to happen will\\nhappen; and with such a consolation, it won\\'t be long afore he submits\\nto the rationality of killing a four-footed beast, to save the lives of\\nhuman men. It may be as you say,\" he continued, reverting to the purport\\nof Heyward\\'s last remark; \"and the greater the reason why we should cut\\nour steaks, and let the carcase drive down the stream, or we shall have\\nthe pack howling along the cliffs, begrudging every mouthful we swallow.\\nBesides, though the Delaware tongue is the same as a book to the\\nIroquois, the cunning varlets are quick enough at understanding the\\nreason of a wolf\\'s howl.\"\\n\\nThe scout, whilst making his remarks, was busied in collecting certain\\nnecessary implements; as he concluded, he moved silently by the group of\\ntravellers, accompanied by the Mohicans, who seemed to comprehend his\\nintentions with instinctive readiness, when the whole three disappeared\\nin succession, seeming to vanish against the dark face of a\\nperpendicular rock, that rose to the height of a few yards within as\\nmany feet of the water\\'s edge.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n  \"Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide;\\n  He wales a portion with judicious care;\\n  And \\'Let us worship God,\\' he says, with solemn air.\"\\n\\n  BURNS.\\n\\n\\nHeyward, and his female companions, witnessed this mysterious movement\\nwith secret uneasiness; for, though the conduct of the white man had\\nhitherto been above reproach, his rude equipments, blunt address, and\\nstrong antipathies, together with the character of his silent\\nassociates, were all causes for exciting distrust in minds that had been\\nso recently alarmed by Indian treachery.\\n\\nThe stranger alone disregarded the passing incidents. He seated himself\\non a projection of the rocks, whence he gave no other signs of\\nconsciousness than by the struggles of his spirit, as manifested in\\nfrequent and heavy sighs. Smothered voices were next heard, as though\\nmen called to each other in the bowels of the earth, when a sudden light\\nflashed upon those without, and laid bare the much-prized secret of the\\nplace.\\n\\nAt the farther extremity of a narrow, deep cavern in the rock, whose\\nlength appeared much extended by the perspective and the nature of the\\nlight by which it was seen, was seated the scout, holding a blazing knot\\nof pine. The strong glare of the fire fell full upon his sturdy,\\nweather-beaten countenance and forest attire, lending an air of romantic\\nwildness to the aspect of an individual, who, seen by the sober light of\\nday, would have exhibited the peculiarities of a man remarkable for the\\nstrangeness of his dress, the iron-like inflexibility of his frame, and\\nthe singular compound of quick, vigilant sagacity, and of exquisite\\nsimplicity, that by turns usurped the possession of his muscular\\nfeatures. At a little distance in advance stood Uncas, his whole person\\nthrown powerfully into view. The travellers anxiously regarded the\\nupright, flexible figure of the young Mohican, graceful and unrestrained\\nin the attitudes and movements of nature. Though his person was more\\nthan usually screened by a green and fringed hunting-shirt, like that of\\nthe white man, there was no concealment to his dark, glancing, fearless\\neye, alike terrible and calm; the bold outline of his high, haughty\\nfeatures, pure in their native red; or to the dignified elevation of his\\nreceding forehead, together with all the finest proportions of a noble\\nhead, bared to the generous scalping tuft. It was the first opportunity\\npossessed by Duncan and his companions, to view the marked lineaments of\\neither of their Indian attendants, and each individual of the party felt\\nrelieved from a burden of doubt, as the proud and determined, though\\nwild expression of the features of the young warrior forced itself on\\ntheir notice. They felt it might be a being partially benighted in the\\nvale of ignorance, but it could not be one who would willingly devote\\nhis rich natural gifts to the purposes of wanton treachery. The\\ningenuous Alice gazed at his free air and proud carriage, as she would\\nhave looked upon some precious relic of the Grecian chisel, to which\\nlife had been imparted by the intervention of a miracle; while Heyward,\\nthough accustomed to see the perfection of form which abounds among the\\nuncorrupted natives, openly expressed his admiration at such an\\nunblemished specimen of the noblest proportions of man.\\n\\n\"I could sleep in peace,\" whispered Alice, in reply, \"with such a\\nfearless and generous looking youth for my sentinel. Surely, Duncan,\\nthose cruel murders, those terrific scenes of torture, of which we read\\nand hear so much, are never acted in the presence of such as he!\"\\n\\n\"This, certainly, is a rare and brilliant instance of those natural\\nqualities, in which these peculiar people are said to excel,\" he\\nanswered. \"I agree with you, Alice, in thinking that such a front and\\neye were formed rather to intimidate than to deceive; but let us not\\npractise a deception upon ourselves, by expecting any other exhibition\\nof what we esteem virtue than according to the fashion of a savage. As\\nbright examples of great qualities are but too uncommon among\\nChristians, so are they singular and solitary with the Indians; though,\\nfor the honor of our common nature, neither are incapable of producing\\nthem. Let us then hope that this Mohican may not disappoint our wishes,\\nbut prove, what his looks assert him to be, a brave and constant\\nfriend.\"\\n\\n\"Now Major Heyward speaks as Major Heyward should,\" said Cora; \"who,\\nthat looks at this creature of nature, remembers the shade of his skin!\"\\n\\nA short, and apparently an embarrassed silence succeeded this remark,\\nwhich was interrupted by the scout calling to them, aloud, to enter.\\n\\n\"This fire begins to show too bright a flame,\" he continued, as they\\ncomplied, \"and might light the Mingos to our undoing. Uncas, drop the\\nblanket, and show the knaves its dark side. This is not such a supper as\\na major of the Royal Americans has a right to expect, but I\\'ve known\\nstout detachments of the corps glad to eat their venison raw, and\\nwithout a relish too.[12] Here, you see, we have plenty of salt, and can\\nmake a quick broil. There\\'s fresh sassafras boughs for the ladies to sit\\non, which may not be as proud as their my-hog-guinea chairs, but which\\nsends up a sweeter flavor than the skin of any hog can do, be it of\\nGuinea, or be it of any other land. Come, friend, don\\'t be mournful for\\nthe colt; \\'twas an innocent thing, and had not seen much hardship. Its\\ndeath will save the creature many a sore back and weary foot!\"\\n\\nUncas did as the other had directed, and when the voice of Hawkeye\\nceased, the roar of the cataract sounded like the rumbling of distant\\nthunder.\\n\\n\"Are we quite safe in this cavern?\" demanded Heyward. \"Is there no\\ndanger of surprise? A single armed man, at its entrance, would hold us\\nat his mercy.\"\\n\\nA spectral-looking figure stalked from out the darkness behind the\\nscout, and seizing a blazing brand, held it towards the farther\\nextremity of their place of retreat. Alice uttered a faint shriek, and\\neven Cora rose to her feet, as this appalling object moved into the\\nlight; but a single word from Heyward calmed them, with the assurance it\\nwas only their attendant, Chingachgook, who, lifting another blanket,\\ndiscovered that the cavern had two outlets. Then, holding the brand, he\\ncrossed a deep, narrow chasm in the rocks, which ran at right angles\\nwith the passage they were in, but which, unlike that, was open to the\\nheavens, and entered another cave, answering to the description of the\\nfirst, in every essential particular.\\n\\n\"Such old foxes as Chingachgook and myself are not often caught in a\\nburrow with one hole,\" said Hawkeye, laughing; \"you can easily see the\\ncunning of the place--the rock is black limestone, which everybody knows\\nis soft; it makes no uncomfortable pillow, where brush and pine wood is\\nscarce; well, the fall was once a few yards below us, and I dare to say\\nwas, in its time, as regular and as handsome a sheet of water as any\\nalong the Hudson. But old age is a great injury to good looks, as these\\nsweet young ladies have yet to l\\'arn! The place is sadly changed! These\\nrocks are full of cracks, and in some places they are softer than at\\nothersome, and the water has worked out deep hollows for itself, until\\nit has fallen back, ay, some hundred feet, breaking here and wearing\\nthere, until the falls have neither shape nor consistency.\"\\n\\n\"In what part of them are we?\" asked Heyward.\\n\\n\"Why, we are nigh the spot that Providence first placed them at, but\\nwhere, it seems, they were too rebellious to stay. The rock proved\\nsofter on each side of us, and so they left the centre of the river bare\\nand dry, first working out these two little holes for us to hide in.\"\\n\\n\"We are then on an island?\"\\n\\n\"Ay! there are the falls on two sides of us, and the river above and\\nbelow. If you had daylight, it would be worth the trouble to step up on\\nthe height of this rock, and look at the perversity of the water. It\\nfalls by no rule at all; sometimes it leaps, sometimes it tumbles;\\nthere, it skips; here, it shoots; in one place \\'tis white as snow, and\\nin another \\'tis green as grass; hereabouts, it pitches into deep\\nhollows, that rumble and quake the \\'arth; and hereaway, it ripples and\\nsings like a brook, fashioning whirlpools and gulleys in the old stone,\\nas it \\'twas no harder than trodden clay. The whole design of the river\\nseems disconcerted. First it runs smoothly, as if meaning to go down the\\ndescent as things were ordered; then it angles about and faces the\\nshores; nor are there places wanting where it looks backward, as if\\nunwilling to leave the wilderness, to mingle with the salt! Ay, lady,\\nthe fine cobweb-looking cloth you wear at your throat, is coarse, and\\nlike a fish-net, to little spots I can show you, where the river\\nfabricates all sorts of images, as if, having broke loose from order, it\\nwould try its hand at everything. And yet what does it amount to! After\\nthe water has been suffered to have its will, for a time, like a\\nheadstrong man, it is gathered together by the hand that made it, and a\\nfew rods below you may see it all, flowing on steadily towards the sea,\\nas was foreordained from the first foundation of the \\'arth!\"\\n\\nWhile his auditors received a cheering assurance of the security of\\ntheir place of concealment, from this untutored description of\\nGlenn\\'s,[13] they were much inclined to judge differently from Hawkeye,\\nof its wild beauties. But they were not in a situation to suffer their\\nthoughts to dwell on the charms of natural objects; and, as the scout\\nhad not found it necessary to cease his culinary labors while he spoke,\\nunless to point out, with a broken fork, the direction of some\\nparticularly obnoxious point in the rebellious stream, they now suffered\\ntheir attention to be drawn to the necessary, though more vulgar\\nconsideration of their supper.\\n\\nThe repast, which was greatly aided by the addition of a few delicacies\\nthat Heyward had the precaution to bring with him when they left their\\nhorses, was exceedingly refreshing to the wearied party. Uncas acted as\\nattendant to the females, performing all the little offices within his\\npower, with a mixture of dignity and anxious grace, that served to amuse\\nHeyward, who well knew that it was an utter innovation on the Indian\\ncustoms, which forbid their warriors to descend to any menial\\nemployment, especially in favor of their women. As the rites of\\nhospitality were, however, considered sacred among them, this little\\ndeparture from the dignity of manhood excited no audible comment. Had\\nthere been one there sufficiently disengaged to become a close observer,\\nhe might have fancied that the services of the young chief were not\\nentirely impartial. That while he tendered to Alice the gourd of sweet\\nwater and the venison in a trencher, neatly carved from the knot of the\\npepperidge, with sufficient courtesy, in performing the same offices to\\nher sister, his dark eye lingered on her rich, speaking countenance.\\nOnce or twice he was compelled to speak, to command the attention of\\nthose he served. In such cases, he made use of English, broken and\\nimperfect, but sufficiently intelligible, and which he rendered so mild\\nand musical, by his deep,[14] guttural voice, that it never failed to\\ncause both ladies to look up in admiration and astonishment. In the\\ncourse of these civilities, a few sentences were exchanged, that served\\nto establish the appearance of an amicable intercourse between the\\nparties.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the gravity of Chingachgook remained immovable. He had\\nseated himself more within the circle of light, where the frequent\\nuneasy glances of his guests were better enabled to separate the natural\\nexpression of his face from the artificial terrors of the war-paint.\\nThey found a strong resemblance between father and son, with the\\ndifference that might be expected from age and hardships. The fierceness\\nof his countenance now seemed to slumber, and in its place was to be\\nseen the quiet, vacant composure, which distinguishes an Indian warrior,\\nwhen his faculties are not required for any of the greater purposes of\\nhis existence. It was, however, easy to be seen, by the occasional\\ngleams that shot across his swarthy visage, that it was only necessary\\nto arouse his passions, in order to give full effect to the terrific\\ndevice which he had adopted to intimidate his enemies. On the other\\nhand, the quick, roving eye of the scout seldom rested. He ate and drank\\nwith an appetite that no sense of danger could disturb, but his\\nvigilance seemed never to desert him. Twenty times the gourd or the\\nvenison was suspended before his lips, while his head was turned aside,\\nas though he listened to some distant and distrusted sounds--a movement\\nthat never failed to recall his guests from regarding the novelties of\\ntheir situation, to a recollection of the alarming reasons that had\\ndriven them to seek it. As these frequent pauses were never followed by\\nany remark, the momentary uneasiness they created quickly passed away,\\nand for a time was forgotten.\\n\\n\"Come, friend,\" said Hawkeye, drawing out a keg from beneath a cover of\\nleaves, towards the close of the repast, and addressing the stranger who\\nsat at his elbow, doing great justice to his culinary skill, \"try a\\nlittle spruce; \\'twill wash away all thoughts of the colt, and quicken\\nthe life in your bosom. I drink to our better friendship, hoping that a\\nlittle horse-flesh may leave no heartburnings atween us. How do you name\\nyourself?\"\\n\\n\"Gamut--David Gamut,\" returned the singing-master, preparing to wash\\ndown his sorrows in a powerful draught of the woodman\\'s high-flavored\\nand well-laced compound.\\n\\n\"A very good name, and, I dare say, handed down from honest\\nforefathers. I\\'m an admirator of names, though the Christian fashions\\nfall far below savage customs in this particular. The biggest coward I\\never knew was called Lyon; and his wife, Patience, would scold you out\\nof hearing in less time than a hunted deer would run a rod. With an\\nIndian \\'tis a matter of conscience; what he calls himself, he generally\\nis--not that Chingachgook, which signifies Big Sarpent, is really a\\nsnake, big or little; but that he understands the windings and turnings\\nof human natur\\', and is silent, and strikes his enemies when they least\\nexpect him. What may be your calling?\"\\n\\n\"I am an unworthy instructor in the art of psalmody.\"\\n\\n\"Anan!\"\\n\\n\"I teach singing to the youths, of the Connecticut levy.\"\\n\\n\"You might be better employed. The young hounds go laughing and singing\\ntoo much already through the woods, when they ought not to breathe\\nlouder than a fox in his cover. Can you use the smooth bore, or handle\\nthe rifle?\"\\n\\n\"Praised be God, I have never had occasion to meddle with murderous\\nimplements!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you understand the compass, and lay down the water-courses and\\nmountains of the wilderness on paper, in order that they who follow may\\nfind places by their given names?\"\\n\\n\"I practise no such employment.\"\\n\\n\"You have a pair of legs that might make a long path seem short! you\\njourney sometimes, I fancy, with tidings for the general.\"\\n\\n\"Never; I follow no other than my own high vocation, which is\\ninstruction in sacred music!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a strange calling!\" muttered Hawkeye, with an inward laugh, \"to go\\nthrough life, like a catbird, mocking all the ups and downs that may\\nhappen to come out of other men\\'s throats. Well, friend, I suppose it is\\nyour gift, and mustn\\'t be denied any more than if \\'twas shooting, or\\nsome other better inclination. Let us hear what you can do in that way;\\n\\'twill be a friendly manner of saying good-night, for \\'tis time that\\nthese ladies should be getting strength for a hard and a long push, in\\nthe pride of the morning, afore the Maquas are stirring!\"\\n\\n\"With joyful pleasure do I consent,\" said David, adjusting his\\niron-rimmed spectacles, and producing his beloved little volume, which\\nhe immediately tendered to Alice. \"What can be more fitting and\\nconsolatory, than to offer up evening praise, after a day of such\\nexceeding jeopardy!\"\\n\\nAlice smiled; but regarding Heyward, she blushed and hesitated.\\n\\n\"Indulge yourself,\" he whispered: \"ought not the suggestion of the\\nworthy namesake of the Psalmist to have its weight at such a moment?\"\\n\\nEncouraged by his opinion, Alice did what her pious inclinations and her\\nkeen relish for gentle sounds, had before so strongly urged. The book\\nwas open at a hymn not ill adapted to their situation, and in which the\\npoet, no longer goaded by his desire to excel the inspired king of\\nIsrael, had discovered some chastened and respectable powers. Cora\\nbetrayed a disposition to support her sister, and the sacred song\\nproceeded, after the indispensable preliminaries of the pitch-pipe and\\nthe tune had been duly attended to by the methodical David.\\n\\nThe air was solemn and slow. At times it rose to the fullest compass of\\nthe rich voices of the females, who hung over their little book in holy\\nexcitement, and again it sank so low, that the rushing of the waters ran\\nthrough their melody, like a hollow accompaniment. The natural taste and\\ntrue ear of David governed and modified the sounds to suit the confined\\ncavern, every crevice, and cranny of which was filled with the thrilling\\nnotes of their flexible voices. The Indians riveted their eyes on the\\nrocks, and listened with an attention that seemed to turn them into\\nstone. But the scout, who had placed his chin in his hand, with an\\nexpression of cold indifference, gradually suffered his rigid features\\nto relax, until, as verse succeeded verse, he felt his iron nature\\nsubdued, while his recollection was carried back to boyhood, when his\\nears had been accustomed to listen to similar sounds of praise, in the\\nsettlements of the colony. His roving eyes began to moisten, and before\\nthe hymn was ended, scalding tears rolled out of fountains that had long\\nseemed dry, and followed each other down those cheeks, that had oftener\\nfelt the storms of heaven than any testimonials of weakness. The singers\\nwere dwelling on one of those low, dying chords, which the ear devours\\nwith such greedy rapture, as if conscious that it is about to lose them,\\nwhen a cry, that seemed neither human nor earthly, rose in the outward\\nair, penetrating not only the recesses of the cavern, but to the inmost\\nhearts of all who heard it. It was followed by a stillness apparently as\\ndeep as if the waters had been checked in their furious progress, at\\nsuch a horrid and unusual interruption.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" murmured Alice, after a few moments of terrible suspense.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" repeated Heyward aloud.\\n\\nNeither Hawkeye nor the Indians made any reply. They listened, as if\\nexpecting the sound would be repeated, with a manner that expressed\\ntheir own astonishment. At length they spoke together earnestly, in the\\nDelaware language, when Uncas, passing by the inner and most concealed\\naperture, cautiously left the cavern. When he had gone, the scout first\\nspoke in English.\\n\\n\"What it is, or what it is not, none here can tell; though two of us\\nhave ranged the woods for more than thirty years! I did believe there\\nwas no cry that Indians or beast could make, that my ears had not heard;\\nbut this has proved that I was only a vain and conceited mortal!\"\\n\\n\"Was it not, then, the shout the warriors make when they wish to\\nintimidate their enemies?\" asked Cora, who stood drawing her veil about\\nher person, with a calmness to which her agitated sister was a stranger.\\n\\n\"No, no; this was bad, and shocking, and had a sort of unhuman sound;\\nbut when you once hear the war-whoop, you will never mistake it for\\nanything else! Well, Uncas!\" speaking in Delaware to the young chief as\\nhe re-entered, \"what see you? do our lights shine through the blankets?\"\\n\\nThe answer was short, and apparently decided, being given in the same\\ntongue.\\n\\n\"There is nothing to be seen without,\" continued Hawkeye, shaking his\\nhead in discontent; \"and our hiding-place is still in darkness! Pass\\ninto the other cave, you that need it, and seek for sleep; we must be\\nafoot long before the sun, and make the most of our time to get to\\nEdward, while the Mingos are taking their morning nap.\"\\n\\nCora set the example of compliance, with a steadiness that taught the\\nmore timid Alice the necessity of obedience. Before leaving the place,\\nhowever, she whispered a request to Duncan that he would follow. Uncas\\nraised the blanket for their passage, and as the sisters turned to thank\\nhim for this act of attention, they saw the scout seated again before\\nthe dying embers, with his face resting on his hands, in a manner which\\nshowed how deeply he brooded on the unaccountable interruption which\\nhad broken up their evening devotions.\\n\\nHeyward took with him a blazing knot, which threw a dim light through\\nthe narrow vista of their new apartment. Placing it in a favorable\\nposition, he joined the females, who now found themselves alone with him\\nfor the first time since they had left the friendly ramparts of Fort\\nEdward.\\n\\n\"Leave us not, Duncan,\" said Alice; \"we cannot sleep in such a place as\\nthis, with that horrid cry still ringing in our ears!\"\\n\\n\"First let us examine into the security of your fortress,\" he answered,\\n\"and then we will speak of rest.\"\\n\\nHe approached the farther end of the cavern, to an outlet, which, like\\nthe others, was concealed by blankets, and removing the thick screen,\\nbreathed the fresh and reviving air from the cataract. One arm of the\\nriver flowed through a deep, narrow ravine, which its current had worn\\nin the soft rock, directly beneath his feet, forming an effectual\\ndefence, as he believed, against any danger from that quarter; the\\nwater, a few rods above them, plunging, glancing, and sweeping along, in\\nits most violent and broken manner.\\n\\n\"Nature has made an impenetrable barrier on this side,\" he continued,\\npointing down the perpendicular declivity into the dark current, before\\nhe dropped the blanket; \"and as you know that good men and true are on\\nguard in front, I see no reason why the advice of our honest host should\\nbe disregarded. I am certain Cora will join me in saying that sleep is\\nnecessary to you both.\"\\n\\n\"Cora may submit to the justice of your opinion, though she cannot put\\nit in practise,\" returned the elder sister, who had placed herself by\\nthe side of Alice, on a couch of sassafras; \"there would be other causes\\nto chase away sleep, though we had been spared the shock of this\\nmysterious noise. Ask yourself, Heyward, can daughters forget the\\nanxiety a father must endure, whose children lodge, he knows not where\\nor how, in such a wilderness, and in the midst of so many perils?\"\\n\\n\"He is a soldier, and knows how to estimate the chances of the woods.\"\\n\\n\"He is a father, and cannot deny his nature.\"\\n\\n\"How kind has he ever been to all my follies! how tender and indulgent\\nto all my wishes!\" sobbed Alice. \"We have been selfish, sister, in\\nurging our visit at such hazard!\"\\n\\n\"I may have been rash in pressing his consent in a moment of much\\nembarrassment, but I would have proved to him, that however others might\\nneglect him in his strait, his children at least were faithful!\"\\n\\n\"When he heard of your arrival at Edward,\" said Heyward, kindly, \"there\\nwas a powerful struggle in his bosom between fear and love; though the\\nlatter, heightened, if possible, by so long a separation, quickly\\nprevailed. \\'It is the spirit of my noble-minded Cora that leads them,\\nDuncan,\\' he said, \\'and I will not balk it. Would to God, that he who\\nholds the honor of our royal master in his guardianship, would show but\\nhalf her firmness!\\'\"\\n\\n\"And did he not speak of me, Heyward?\" demanded Alice, with jealous\\naffection. \"Surely, he forgot not altogether his little Elsie?\"\\n\\n\"That was impossible,\" returned the young man; \"he called you by a\\nthousand endearing epithets, that I may not presume to use, but to the\\njustice of which I can warmly testify. Once, indeed, he said--\"\\n\\nDuncan ceased speaking; for while his eyes were riveted on those of\\nAlice, who had turned towards him with the eagerness of filial\\naffection, to catch his words, the same strong horrid cry, as before,\\nfilled the air, and rendered him mute. A long, breathless silence\\nsucceeded, during which each looked at the others in fearful expectation\\nof hearing the sound repeated. At length the blanket was slowly raised,\\nand the scout stood in the aperture with a countenance whose firmness\\nevidently began to give way, before a mystery that seemed to threaten\\nsome danger, against which all his cunning and experience might prove of\\nno avail.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n                            \"Be gay securely;\\n  Dispel, my fair, with smiles, the tim\\'rous clouds,\\n  That hang on thy clear brow.\"\\n\\n  _Death of Agrippina._\\n\\n\\nThe sudden and almost magical change, from the stirring incidents of the\\ncombat to the stillness that now reigned around him, acted on the heated\\nimagination of Heyward like some exciting dream. While all the images\\nand events he had witnessed remained deeply impressed on his memory, he\\nfelt a difficulty in persuading himself of their truth. Still ignorant\\nof the fate of those who had trusted to the aid of the swift current, he\\nat first listened intently to any signal, or sounds of alarm, which\\nmight announce the good or evil fortune of their hazardous undertaking.\\nHis attention was, however, bestowed in vain; for, with the\\ndisappearance of Uncas, every sign of the adventurers had been lost,\\nleaving him in total uncertainty of their fate.\\n\\nIn a moment of such painful doubt, Duncan did not hesitate to look about\\nhim, without consulting that protection from the rocks which just before\\nhad been so necessary to his safety. Every effort, however, to detect\\nthe least evidence of the approach of their hidden enemies, was as\\nfruitless as the inquiry after his late companions. The wooded banks of\\nthe rivers seemed again deserted by everything possessing animal life.\\nThe uproar which had so lately echoed through the vaults of the forest\\nwas gone, leaving the rush of the waters to swell and sink on the\\ncurrents of the air, in the unmingled sweetness of nature. A fish-hawk,\\nwhich, secure on the topmost branches of a dead pine, had been a distant\\nspectator of the fray, now stooped from his high and ragged perch, and\\nsoared, in wide sweeps, above his prey; while a jay, whose noisy voice\\nhad been stilled by the hoarser cries of the savages, ventured again to\\nopen his discordant throat, as though once more in undisturbed\\npossession of his wild domains. Duncan caught from these natural\\naccompaniments of the solitary scene a glimmering of hope; and he began\\nto rally his faculties to renewed exertions, with something like a\\nreviving confidence of success.\\n\\n\"The Hurons are not to be seen,\" he said, addressing David, who had by\\nno means recovered from the effects of the stunning blow he had\\nreceived; \"let us conceal ourselves in the cavern, and trust the rest to\\nProvidence.\"\\n\\n\"I remember to have united with two comely maidens, in lifting up our\\nvoices in praise and thanksgiving,\" returned the bewildered\\nsinging-master; \"since which time I have been visited by a heavy\\njudgment for my sins. I have been mocked with the likeness of sleep,\\nwhile sounds of discord have rent my ears, such as might manifest the\\nfulness of time, and that nature had forgotten her harmony.\"\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! thine own period was, in truth, near its accomplishment!\\nBut arouse, and come with me; I will lead you where all other sounds but\\nthose of your own psalmody shall be excluded.\"\\n\\n\"There is melody in the fall of the cataract, and the rushing of many\\nwaters is sweet to the senses!\" said David, pressing his hand confusedly\\non his brow. \"Is not the air yet filled with shrieks and cries, as\\nthough the departed spirits of the damned--\"\\n\\n\"Not now, not now,\" interrupted the impatient Heyward, \"they have\\nceased, and they who raised them, I trust in God, they are gone too!\\neverything but the water is still and at peace; in, then, where you may\\ncreate those sounds you love so well to hear.\"\\n\\nDavid smiled sadly, though not without a momentary gleam of pleasure, at\\nthis allusion to his beloved vocation. He no longer hesitated to be led\\nto a spot which promised such unalloyed gratification to his wearied\\nsenses; and, leaning on the arm of his companion, he entered the narrow\\nmouth of the cave. Duncan seized a pile of the sassafras, which he drew\\nbefore the passage, studiously concealing every appearance of an\\naperture. Within this fragile barrier he arranged the blankets abandoned\\nby the foresters, darkening the inner extremity of the cavern, while its\\nouter received a chastened light from the narrow ravine, through which\\none arm of the river rushed, to form the junction with its sister\\nbranch, a few rods below.\\n\\n\"I like not that principle of the natives, which teaches them to submit\\nwithout a struggle, in emergencies that appear desperate,\" he said,\\nwhile busied in this employment; \"our own maxim, which says, \\'while life\\nremains there is hope,\\' is more consoling, and better suited to a\\nsoldier\\'s temperament. To you, Cora, I will urge no words of idle\\nencouragement; your own fortitude and undisturbed reason will teach you\\nall that may become your sex; but cannot we dry the tears of that\\ntrembling weeper on your bosom?\"\\n\\n\"I am calmer, Duncan,\" said Alice, raising herself from the arms of her\\nsister, and forcing an appearance of composure through her tears; \"much\\ncalmer, now. Surely, in this hidden spot we are safe, we are secret,\\nfree from injury; we will hope everything from those generous men who\\nhave risked so much already in our behalf.\"\\n\\n\"Now does our gentle Alice speak like a daughter of Munro!\" said\\nHeyward, pausing to press her hand as he passed towards the outer\\nentrance of the cavern. \"With two such examples of courage before him, a\\nman would be ashamed to prove other than a hero.\" He then seated himself\\nin the centre of the cavern, grasping his remaining pistol with a hand\\nconvulsively clenched, while his contracted and frowning eye announced\\nthe sullen desperation of his purpose. \"The Hurons, if they come, may\\nnot gain our position so easily as they think,\" he lowly muttered; and\\ndropping his head back against the rock, he seemed to await the result\\nin patience, though his gaze was unceasingly bent on the open avenue to\\ntheir place of retreat.\\n\\nWith the last sound of his voice, a deep, a long, and almost breathless\\nsilence succeeded. The fresh air of the morning had penetrated the\\nrecess, and its influence was gradually felt on the spirits of its\\ninmates. As minute after minute passed by, leaving them in undisturbed\\nsecurity, the insinuating feeling of hope was gradually gaining\\npossession of every bosom, though each one felt reluctant to give\\nutterance to expectations that the next moment might so fearfully\\ndestroy.\\n\\nDavid alone formed an exception to these varying emotions. A gleam of\\nlight from the opening crossed his wan countenance, and fell upon the\\npages of the little volume, whose leaves he was again occupied in\\nturning, as if searching for some song more fitted to their condition\\nthan any that had yet met his eye. He was, most probably, acting all\\nthis time under a confused recollection of the promised consolation of\\nDuncan. At length, it would seem, his patient industry found its reward;\\nfor, without explanation or apology, he pronounced aloud the words \"Isle\\nof Wight,\" drew a long, sweet sound from his pitch-pipe, and then ran\\nthrough the preliminary modulations of the air, whose name he had just\\nmentioned with the sweeter tones of his own musical voice.\\n\\n\"May not this prove dangerous?\" asked Cora, glancing her dark eye at\\nMajor Heyward.\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! his voice is too feeble to be heard amid the din of the\\nfalls,\" was the answer; \"besides, the cavern will prove his friend. Let\\nhim indulge his passion, since it may be done without hazard.\"\\n\\n\"Isle of Wight!\" repeated David, looking about him with that dignity\\nwith which he had long been wont to silence the whispering echoes of his\\nschool; \"\\'tis a brave tune, and set to solemn words; let it be sung with\\nmeet respect!\"\\n\\nAfter allowing a moment of stillness, to enforce his discipline, the\\nvoice of the singer was heard, in low, murmuring syllables, gradually\\nstealing on the ear, until it filled the narrow vault with sounds\\nrendered trebly thrilling by the feeble and tremulous utterance produced\\nby his debility. The melody, which no weakness could destroy, gradually\\nwrought its sweet influence on the senses of those who heard it. It even\\nprevailed over the miserable travesty of the song of David which the\\nsinger had selected from a volume of similar effusions, and caused the\\nsense to be forgotten in the insinuating harmony of the sounds. Alice\\nunconsciously dried her tears, and bent her melting eyes on the pallid\\nfeatures of Gamut with an expression of chastened delight that she\\nneither affected nor wished to conceal. Cora bestowed an approving smile\\non the pious efforts of the namesake of the Jewish prince, and Heyward\\nsoon turned his steady, stern look from the outlet of the cavern, to\\nfasten it, with a milder character, on the face of David, or to meet the\\nwandering beams which at moments strayed from the humid eyes of Alice.\\nThe open sympathy of the listeners stirred the spirit of the votary of\\nmusic, whose voice regained its richness and volume, without losing that\\ntouching softness which proved its secret charm. Exerting his renovated\\npowers to their utmost, he was yet filling the arches of the cave with\\nlong and full tones, when a yell burst into the air without, that\\ninstantly stilled his pious strains, choking his voice suddenly, as\\nthough his heart had literally bounded into the passage of his throat.\\n\\n\"We are lost!\" exclaimed Alice, throwing herself into the arms of Cora.\\n\\n\"Not yet, not yet,\" returned the agitated but undaunted Heyward; \"the\\nsound came from the centre of the island, and it has been produced by\\nthe sight of their dead companions. We are not yet discovered, and there\\nis still hope.\"\\n\\nFaint and almost despairing as was the prospect of escape, the words of\\nDuncan were not thrown away, for it awakened the powers of the sisters\\nin such a manner that they awaited the result in silence. A second yell\\nsoon followed the first, when a rush of voices was heard pouring down\\nthe island, from its upper to its lower extremity, until they reached\\nthe naked rock above the caverns, where, after a shout of savage\\ntriumph, the air continued full of horrible cries and screams, such as\\nman alone can utter, and he only when in a state of the fiercest\\nbarbarity.\\n\\nThe sounds quickly spread around them in every direction. Some called to\\ntheir fellows from the water\\'s edge, and were answered from the heights\\nabove. Cries were heard in the startling vicinity of the chasm between\\nthe two caves, which mingled with hoarser yells that arose out of the\\nabyss of the deep ravine. In short, so rapidly had the savage sounds\\ndiffused themselves over the barren rock, that it was not difficult for\\nthe anxious listeners to imagine they could be heard beneath, as in\\ntruth they were above and on every side of them.\\n\\nIn the midst of this tumult, a triumphant yell was raised within a few\\nyards of the hidden entrance to the cave. Heyward abandoned every hope,\\nwith the belief it was the signal that they were discovered. Again the\\nimpression passed away, as he heard the voices collect near the spot\\nwhere the white man had so reluctantly abandoned his rifle. Amid the\\njargon of the Indian dialects that he now plainly heard, it was easy to\\ndistinguish not only words, but sentences, in the _patois_ of the\\nCanadas. A burst of voices had shouted simultaneously, \"La Longue\\nCarabine!\" causing the opposite woods to re-echo with a name which,\\nHeyward well remembered, had been given by his enemies to a celebrated\\nhunter and scout of the English camp, and who, he now learnt for the\\nfirst time, had been his late companion.\\n\\n\"La Longue Carabine! La Longue Carabine!\" passed from mouth to mouth,\\nuntil the whole band appeared to be collected around a trophy which\\nwould seem to announce the death of its formidable owner. After a\\nvociferous consultation, which was, at times, deafened by bursts of\\nsavage joy, they again separated, filling the air with the name of a\\nfoe, whose body, Heyward could collect from their expressions, they\\nhoped to find concealed in some crevice of the island.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he whispered to the trembling sisters, \"now is the moment of\\nuncertainty! if our place of retreat escape this scrutiny, we are still\\nsafe! In every event, we are assured, by what has fallen from our\\nenemies, that our friends have escaped, and in two short hours we may\\nlook for succor from Webb.\"\\n\\nThere were now a few minutes of fearful stillness, during which Heyward\\nwell knew that the savages conducted their search with greater vigilance\\nand method. More than once he could distinguish their footsteps, as they\\nbrushed the sassafras, causing the faded leaves to rustle, and the\\nbranches to snap. At length, the pile yielded a little, a corner of the\\nblanket fell, and a faint ray of light gleamed into the inner part of\\nthe cave. Cora folded Alice to her bosom in agony, and Duncan sprang to\\nhis feet. A shout was at that moment heard, as if issuing from the\\ncentre of the rock, announcing that the neighboring cavern had at length\\nbeen entered. In a minute, the number and loudness of the voices\\nindicated that the whole party was collected in and around that secret\\nplace.\\n\\nAs the inner passages to the two caves were so close to each other,\\nDuncan, believing that escape was no longer possible, passed David and\\nthe sisters, to place himself between the latter and the first onset of\\nthe terrible meeting. Grown desperate by his situation, he drew nigh the\\nslight barrier which separated him only by a few feet from his\\nrelentless pursuers, and placing his face to the casual opening, he even\\nlooked out, with a sort of desperate indifference, on their movements.\\n\\nWithin reach of his arm was the brawny shoulder of a gigantic Indian,\\nwhose deep and authoritative voice appeared to give directions to the\\nproceedings of his fellows. Beyond him again, Duncan could look into the\\nvault opposite, which was filled with savages, upturning and rifling the\\nhumble furniture of the scout. The wound of David had dyed the leaves of\\nsassafras with a color that the natives well knew was anticipating the\\nseason. Over this sign of their success, they set up a howl, like an\\nopening from so many hounds who had recovered a lost trail. After this\\nyell of victory, they tore up the fragrant bed of the cavern, and bore\\nthe branches into the chasm, scattering the boughs, as if they suspected\\nthem of concealing the person of the man they had so long hated and\\nfeared. One fierce and wild-looking warrior approached the chief\\nbearing a load of the brush, and pointing, exultingly, to the deep red\\nstains with which it was sprinkled, uttered his joy in Indian yells,\\nwhose meaning Heyward was only enabled to comprehend by the frequent\\nrepetition of the name of \"La Longue Carabine!\" When his triumph had\\nceased, he cast the brush on the slight heap that Duncan had made before\\nthe entrance of the second cavern, and closed the view. His example was\\nfollowed by others, who, as they drew the branches from the cave of the\\nscout, threw them into one pile, adding, unconsciously, to the security\\nof those they sought. The very slightness of the defence was its chief\\nmerit, for no one thought of disturbing a mass of brush, which all of\\nthem believed, in that moment of hurry and confusion, had been\\naccidentally raised by the hands of their own party.\\n\\nAs the blankets yielded before the outward pressure, and the branches\\nsettled in the fissure of the rock by their own weight, forming a\\ncompact body, Duncan once more breathed freely. With a light step, and\\nlighter heart, he returned to the centre of the cave, and took the place\\nhe had left, where he could command a view of the opening next the\\nriver. While he was in the act of making this movement, the Indians, as\\nif changing their purpose by a common impulse, broke away from the\\ncavern in a body, and were heard rushing up the island again, towards\\nthe point whence they had originally descended. Here another wailing cry\\nbetrayed that they were again collected around the bodies of their dead\\ncomrades.\\n\\nDuncan now ventured to look at his companions; for, during the most\\ncritical moments of their danger, he had been apprehensive that the\\nanxiety of his countenance might communicate some additional alarm to\\nthose who were so little able to sustain it.\\n\\n\"They are gone, Cora!\" he whispered; \"Alice, they are returned whence\\nthey came, and we are saved! To Heaven, that has alone delivered us from\\nthe grasp of so merciless an enemy, be all the praise!\"\\n\\n\"Then to Heaven will I return my thanks!\" exclaimed the younger sister,\\nrising from the encircling arms of Cora, and casting herself with\\nenthusiastic gratitude on the naked rock; \"to that Heaven who has spared\\nthe tears of a gray-headed father; has saved the lives of those I so\\nmuch love--\"\\n\\nBoth Heyward, and the more tempered Cora, witnessed the act of\\ninvoluntary emotion with powerful sympathy, the former secretly\\nbelieving that piety had never worn a form so lovely as it had now\\nassumed in the youthful person of Alice. Her eyes radiant with the glow\\nof grateful feelings; the flush of her beauty was again seated on her\\ncheeks, and her whole soul seemed ready and anxious to pour out its\\nthanksgivings, through the medium of her eloquent features. But when her\\nlips moved, the words they should have uttered appeared frozen by some\\nnew and sudden chill. Her bloom gave place to the paleness of death; her\\nsoft and melting eyes grew hard, and seemed contracting with horror;\\nwhile those hands which she had raised, clasped in each other, towards\\nheaven, dropped in horizontal lines before her, the fingers pointed\\nforward in convulsed motion. Heyward turned, the instant she gave a\\ndirection to his suspicions, and, peering just above the ledge which\\nformed the threshold of the open outlet of the cavern, he beheld the\\nmalignant, fierce, and savage features of Le Renard Subtil.\\n\\nIn that moment of surprise, the self-possession of Heyward did not\\ndesert him. He observed by the vacant expression of the Indian\\'s\\ncountenance, that his eye, accustomed to the open air, had not yet been\\nable to penetrate the dusky light which pervaded the depth of the\\ncavern. He had even thought of retreating beyond a curvature in the\\nnatural wall, which might still conceal him and his companions, when, by\\nthe sudden gleam of intelligence that shot across the features of the\\nsavage, he saw it was too late, and that they were betrayed.\\n\\nThe look of exultation and brutal triumph which announced this terrible\\ntruth was irresistibly irritating. Forgetful of everything but the\\nimpulses of his hot blood, Duncan levelled his pistol and fired. The\\nreport of the weapon made the cavern bellow like an eruption from a\\nvolcano; and when the smoke it vomited had been driven away before the\\ncurrent of air which issued from the ravine, the place so lately\\noccupied by the features of his treacherous guide was vacant. Rushing to\\nthe outlet, Heyward caught a glimpse of his dark figure, stealing around\\na low and narrow ledge, which soon hid him entirely from sight.\\n\\nAmong the savages, a frightful stillness succeeded the explosion, which\\nhad just been heard bursting from the bowels of the rock. But when Le\\nRenard raised his voice in a long and intelligible whoop, it was\\nanswered by a spontaneous yell from the mouth of every Indian within\\nhearing of the sound. The clamorous noises again rushed down the\\nisland; and before Duncan had time to recover from the shock, his feeble\\nbarrier of brush was scattered to the winds, the cavern was entered at\\nboth its extremities, and he and his companions were dragged from their\\nshelter and borne into the day, where they stood surrounded by the whole\\nband of the triumphant Hurons.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n  \"_Clo._--I am gone, sir,\\n      And anon, sir,\\n  I\\'ll be with you again.\"\\n\\n  _Twelfth Night._\\n\\n\\nThe Hurons stood aghast at this sudden visitation of death on one of\\ntheir band. But, as they regarded the fatal accuracy of an aim which had\\ndared to immolate an enemy at so much hazard to a friend, the name of\\n\"La Longue Carabine\" burst simultaneously from every lip, and was\\nsucceeded by a wild and a sort of plaintive howl. The cry was answered\\nby a loud shout from a little thicket, where the incautious party had\\npiled their arms; and at the next moment, Hawkeye, too eager to load the\\nrifle he had regained, was seen advancing upon them, brandishing the\\nclubbed weapon, and cutting the air with wide and powerful sweeps. Bold\\nand rapid as was the progress of the scout, it was exceeded by that of a\\nlight and vigorous form which, bounding past him, leaped, with\\nincredible activity and daring, into the very centre of the Hurons,\\nwhere it stood, whirling a tomahawk, and flourishing a glittering knife,\\nwith fearful menaces, in front of Cora. Quicker than the thoughts could\\nfollow these unexpected and audacious movements, an image, armed in the\\nemblematic panoply of death, glided before their eyes, and assumed a\\nthreatening attitude at the other\\'s side. The savage tormentors recoiled\\nbefore these warlike intruders, and uttered as they appeared in such\\nquick succession, the often repeated and peculiar exclamation of\\nsurprise, followed by the well known and dreaded appellations of--\\n\\n\"Le Cerf Agile! Le Gros Serpent!\"\\n\\nBut the wary and vigilant leader of the Hurons was not so easily\\ndisconcerted. Casting his keen eyes around the little plain, he\\ncomprehended the nature of the assault at a glance, and encouraging his\\nfollowers by his voice as well as by his example, he unsheathed his long\\nand dangerous knife, and rushed with a loud whoop upon the expecting\\nChingachgook. It was the signal for a general combat. Neither party had\\nfire-arms, and the contest was to be decided in the deadliest manner;\\nhand to hand, with weapons of offence, and none of defence.\\n\\nUncas answered the whoop, and leaping on an enemy, with a single, well\\ndirected blow of his tomahawk, cleft him to the brain. Heyward tore the\\nweapon of Magua from the sapling, and rushed eagerly towards the fray.\\nAs the combatants were now equal in number, each singled an opponent\\nfrom the adverse band. The rush and blows passed with the fury of a\\nwhirlwind, and the swiftness of lightning. Hawkeye soon got another\\nenemy within reach of his arm, and with one sweep of his formidable\\nweapon he beat down the slight and inartificial defences of his\\nantagonist, crushing him to the earth with the blow. Heyward ventured to\\nhurl the tomahawk he had seized, too ardent to await the moment of\\nclosing. It struck the Indian he had selected on the forehead, and\\nchecked for an instant his onward rush. Encouraged by this slight\\nadvantage, the impetuous young man continued his onset, and sprang upon\\nhis enemy with naked hands. A single instant was enough to assure him of\\nthe rashness of the measure, for he immediately found himself fully\\nengaged, with all his activity and courage, in endeavoring to ward the\\ndesperate thrusts made with the knife of the Huron. Unable longer to\\nfoil an enemy so alert and vigilant, he threw his arms about him, and\\nsucceeded in pinning the limbs of the other to his side, with an iron\\ngrasp, but one that was far too exhausting to himself to continue long.\\nIn this extremity he heard a voice near him, shouting--\\n\\n\"Extarminate the varlets! no quarter to an accursed Mingo!\"\\n\\nAt the next moment, the breech of Hawkeye\\'s rifle fell on the naked head\\nof his adversary, whose muscles appeared to wither under the shock, as\\nhe sank from the arms of Duncan, flexible and motionless.\\n\\nWhen Uncas had brained his first antagonist, he turned, like a hungry\\nlion, to seek another. The fifth and only Huron disengaged at the first\\nonset had paused a moment, and then seeing that all around him were\\nemployed in the deadly strife, he sought, with hellish vengeance, to\\ncomplete the baffled work of revenge. Raising a shout of triumph, he\\nsprang towards the defenceless Cora, sending his keen axe, as the\\ndreadful precursor of his approach. The tomahawk grazed her shoulder,\\nand cutting the withes which bound her to the tree, left the maiden at\\nliberty to fly. She eluded the grasp of the savage, and reckless of her\\nown safety, threw herself on the bosom of Alice, striving with\\nconvulsed and ill-directed fingers, to tear asunder the twigs which\\nconfined the person of her sister. Any other than a monster would have\\nrelented at such an act of generous devotion to the best and purest\\naffection; but the breast of the Huron was a stranger to sympathy.\\nSeizing Cora by the rich tresses which fell in confusion about her form,\\nhe tore her from her frantic hold, and bowed her down with brutal\\nviolence to her knees. The savage drew the flowing curls through his\\nhand, and raising them on high with an outstretched arm, he passed the\\nknife around the exquisitely moulded head of his victim, with a taunting\\nand exulting laugh. But he purchased this moment of fierce gratification\\nwith the loss of the fatal opportunity. It was just then the sight\\ncaught the eye of Uncas. Bounding from his footsteps he appeared for an\\ninstant darting through the air, and descending in a ball he fell on the\\nchest of his enemy, driving him many yards from the spot, headlong and\\nprostrate. The violence of the exertion cast the young Mohican at his\\nside. They arose together, fought, and bled, each in his turn. But the\\nconflict was soon decided; the tomahawk of Heyward and the rifle of\\nHawkeye descended on the skull of the Huron, at the same moment that the\\nknife of Uncas reached his heart.\\n\\nThe battle was now entirely terminated, with the exception of the\\nprotracted struggle between Le Renard Subtil and Le Gros Serpent. Well\\ndid these barbarous warriors prove that they deserved those significant\\nnames which had been bestowed for deeds in former wars. When they\\nengaged, some little time was lost in eluding the quick and vigorous\\nthrusts which had been aimed at their lives. Suddenly darting on each\\nother, they closed, and came to the earth, twisted together like twining\\nserpents, in pliant and subtle folds. At the moment when the victors\\nfound themselves unoccupied, the spot where these experienced and\\ndesperate combatants lay, could only be distinguished by a cloud of dust\\nand leaves which moved from the centre of the little plain towards its\\nboundary, as if raised by the passage of a whirlwind. Urged by the\\ndifferent motives of filial affection, friendship, and gratitude,\\nHeyward and his companions rushed with one accord to the place,\\nencircling the little canopy of dust which hung above the warriors. In\\nvain did Uncas dart around the cloud, with a wish to strike his knife\\ninto the heart of his father\\'s foe; the threatening rifle of Hawkeye was\\nraised and suspended in vain, while Duncan endeavored to seize the\\nlimbs of the Huron with hands that appeared to have lost their power.\\nCovered, as they were, with dust and blood, the swift evolutions of the\\ncombatants seemed to incorporate their bodies into one. The death-like\\nlooking figure of the Mohican, and the dark form of the Huron, gleamed\\nbefore their eyes in such quick and confused succession, that the\\nfriends of the former knew not where nor when to plant the succoring\\nblow. It is true there were short and fleeting moments, when the fiery\\neyes of Magua were seen glittering, like the fabled organs of the\\nbasilisk, through the dusty wreath by which he was enveloped, and he\\nread by those short and deadly glances the fate of the combat in the\\npresence of his enemies; ere, however, any hostile hand could descend on\\nhis devoted head, its place was filled by the scowling visage of\\nChingachgook. In this manner the scene of the combat was removed from\\nthe centre of the little plain to its verge. The Mohican now found an\\nopportunity to make a powerful thrust with his knife; Magua suddenly\\nrelinquished his grasp, and fell backward without motion, and seemingly\\nwithout life. His adversary leaped on his feet, making the arches of the\\nforest ring with the sounds of triumph.\\n\\n\"Well done for the Delawares! victory to the Mohican!\" cried Hawkeye,\\nonce more elevating the butt of the long and fatal rifle; \"a finishing\\nblow from a man without a cross will never tell against his honor, nor\\nrob him of his right to the scalp.\"\\n\\nBut, at the very moment when the dangerous weapon was in the act of\\ndescending, the subtle Huron rolled swiftly from beneath the danger,\\nover the edge of the precipice, and falling on his feet, was seen\\nleaping, with a single bound, into the centre of a thicket of low\\nbushes, which clung along its sides. The Delawares, who had believed\\ntheir enemy dead, uttered their exclamation of surprise, and were\\nfollowing with speed and clamor, like hounds in open view of the deer,\\nwhen a shrill and peculiar cry from the scout instantly changed their\\npurpose, and recalled them to the summit of the hill.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas like himself,\" cried the inveterate forester, whose prejudices\\ncontributed so largely to veil his natural sense of justice in all\\nmatters which concerned the Mingos; \"a lying and deceitful varlet as he\\nis. An honest Delaware now, being fairly vanquished, would have lain\\nstill, and been knocked on the head, but these knavish Maquas cling to\\nlife like so many cats-o\\'-the-mountain. Let him go--let him go; \\'tis but\\none man, and he without rifle or bow, many a long mile from his French\\ncommerades; and, like a rattler that has lost his fangs, he can do no\\nfurther mischief, until such time as he, and we too, may leave the\\nprints of our moccasins over a long reach of sandy plain. See, Uncas,\"\\nhe added, in Delaware, \"your father is flaying the scalps already. It\\nmay be well to go round and feel the vagabonds that are left, or we may\\nhave another of them loping through the woods, and screeching like a jay\\nthat has been winged.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nTHE FIGHT IN THE FOREST\\n\\n_The battle was now entirely terminated, with the exception of the\\nprotracted struggle between Le Renard Subtil and Le Gros Serpent_]\\n\\nSo saying, the honest, but implacable scout, made the circuit of the\\ndead, into whose senseless bosoms he thrust his long knife, with as much\\ncoolness as though they had been so many brute carcasses. He had,\\nhowever, been anticipated by the elder Mohican, who had already torn the\\nemblems of victory from the unresisting heads of the slain.\\n\\nBut Uncas, denying his habits, we had almost said his nature, flew with\\ninstinctive delicacy, accompanied by Heyward, to the assistance of the\\nfemales, and quickly releasing Alice, placed her in the arms of Cora. We\\nshall not attempt to describe the gratitude to the Almighty Disposer of\\nevents which glowed in the bosoms of the sisters, who were thus\\nunexpectedly restored to life and to each other. Their thanksgivings\\nwere deep and silent; the offerings of their gentle spirits, burning\\nbrightest and purest on the secret altars of their hearts; and their\\nrenovated and more earthly feelings exhibiting themselves in long and\\nfervent, though speechless caresses. As Alice rose from her knees, where\\nshe had sunk by the side of Cora, she threw herself on the bosom of the\\nlatter; and sobbed aloud the name of their aged father, while her soft,\\ndove-like eyes sparkled with the rays of hope.\\n\\n\"We are saved! we are saved!\" she murmured; \"to return to the arms of\\nour dear, dear father, and his heart will not be broken with grief. And\\nyou too, Cora, my sister; my more than sister, my mother; you too are\\nspared. And Duncan,\" she added, looking round upon the youth with a\\nsmile of ineffable innocence, \"even our own brave and noble Duncan has\\nescaped without a hurt.\"\\n\\nTo these ardent and nearly incoherent words Cora made no other answer\\nthan by straining the youthful speaker to her heart, as she bent over\\nher, in melting tenderness. The manhood of Heyward felt no shame in\\ndropping tears over this spectacle of affectionate rapture; and Uncas\\nstood, fresh and blood-stained from the combat, a calm, and, apparently,\\nan unmoved looker-on, it is true, but with eyes that had already lost\\ntheir fierceness, and were beaming with a sympathy that elevated him far\\nabove the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the\\npractices of his nation.\\n\\nDuring this display of emotions so natural in their situation, Hawkeye,\\nwhose vigilant distrust had satisfied itself that the Hurons, who\\ndisfigured the heavenly scene, no longer possessed the power to\\ninterrupt its harmony, approached David, and liberated him from the\\nbonds he had, until that moment, endured with the most exemplary\\npatience.\\n\\n\"There,\" exclaimed the scout, casting the last withe behind him, \"you\\nare once more master of your own limbs, though you seem not to use them\\nwith greater judgment than that in which they were first fashioned. If\\nadvice from one who is not older than yourself, but who having lived\\nmost of his time in the wilderness, may be said to have experience\\nbeyond his years, will give no offence, you are welcome to my thoughts;\\nand these are, to part with the little tooting instrument in your jacket\\nto the first fool you meet with, and buy some useful we\\'pon with the\\nmoney, if it be only the barrel of a horseman\\'s pistol. By industry and\\ncare, you might thus come to some prefarment; for by this time, I should\\nthink, your eyes would plainly tell you that a carrion crow is a better\\nbird than a mocking thresher. The one will, at least, remove foul sights\\nfrom before the face of man, while the other is only good to brew\\ndisturbances in the woods, by cheating the ears of all that hear them.\"\\n\\n\"Arms and the clarion for the battle, but the song of thanksgiving to\\nthe victory!\" answered the liberated David. \"Friend,\" he added,\\nthrusting forth his lean, delicate hand towards Hawkeye, in kindness,\\nwhile his eyes twinkled and grew moist, \"I thank thee that the hairs of\\nmy head still grow where they were first rooted by Providence; for,\\nthough those of other men may be more glossy and curling, I have ever\\nfound mine own well suited to the brain they shelter. That I did not\\njoin myself to the battle, was less owing to disinclination, than to the\\nbonds of the heathen. Valiant and skilful hast thou proved thyself in\\nthe conflict, and I hereby thank thee, before proceeding to discharge\\nother and more important duties, because thou hast proved thyself well\\nworthy of a Christian\\'s praise.\"\\n\\n\"The thing is but a trifle, and what you may often see, if you tarry\\nlong among us,\" returned the scout, a good deal softened towards the\\nman of song, by this unequivocal expression of gratitude. \"I have got\\nback my old companion, \\'Killdeer,\\'\" he added, striking his hand on the\\nbreech of his rifle; \"and that in itself is a victory. These Iroquois\\nare cunning, but they outwitted themselves when they placed their\\nfire-arms out of reach; and had Uncas or his father been gifted with\\nonly their common Indian patience, we should have come in upon the\\nknaves with three bullets instead of one, and that would have made a\\nfinish of the whole pack; yon loping varlet, as well as his commerades.\\nBut \\'twas all foreordered, and for the best.\"\\n\\n\"Thou sayest well,\" returned David, \"and hast caught the true spirit of\\nChristianity. He that is to be saved will be saved, and he that is\\npredestined to be damned will be damned. This is the doctrine of truth,\\nand most consoling and refreshing it is to the true believer.\"\\n\\nThe scout, who by this time was seated, examining into the state of his\\nrifle with a species of parental assiduity, now looked up at the other\\nin a displeasure that he did not affect to conceal, roughly interrupting\\nfurther speech.\\n\\n\"Doctrine, or no doctrine,\" said the sturdy woodsman, \"\\'tis the belief\\nof knaves, and the curse of an honest man. I can credit that yonder\\nHuron was to fall by my hand, for with my own eyes I have seen it; but\\nnothing short of being a witness will cause me to think he had met with\\nany reward, or that Chingachgook, there, will be condemned at the final\\nday.\"\\n\\n\"You have no warranty for such an audacious doctrine, nor any covenant\\nto support it,\" cried David, who was deeply tinctured with the subtle\\ndistinctions which, in his time, and more especially in his province,\\nhad been drawn around the beautiful simplicity of revelation, by\\nendeavoring to penetrate the awful mystery of the divine nature,\\nsupplying faith by self-sufficiency, and by consequence, involving those\\nwho reasoned from such human dogmas in absurdities and doubt; \"your\\ntemple is reared on the sands, and the first tempest will wash away its\\nfoundation. I demand your authorities for such an uncharitable assertion\\n(like other advocates of a system, David was not always accurate in his\\nuse of terms). Name chapter and verse; in which of the holy books do you\\nfind language to support you?\"\\n\\n\"Book!\" repeated Hawkeye, with singular and ill-concealed disdain; \"do\\nyou take me for a whimpering boy at the apron-string of one of your old\\ngals; and this good rifle on my knee for the feather of a goose\\'s wing,\\nmy ox\\'s horn for a bottle of ink, and my leathern pouch for a\\ncross-barred handkercher to carry my dinner? Book! what have such as I,\\nwho am a warrior of the wilderness, though a man without a cross, to do\\nwith books? I never read but in one, and the words that are written\\nthere are too simple and too plain to need much schooling; though I may\\nboast that of forty long and hard-working years.\"\\n\\n\"What call you the volume?\" said David, misconceiving the other\\'s\\nmeaning.\\n\\n\"Tis open before your eyes,\" returned the scout; \"and he who owns it is\\nnot a niggard of its use. I have heard it said that there are men who\\nread in books to convince themselves there is a God. I know not but man\\nmay so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so\\nclear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests. If\\nany such there be, and he will follow me from sun to sun, through the\\nwindings of the forest, he shall see enough to teach him that he is a\\nfool, and that the greatest of his folly lies in striving to rise to the\\nlevel of One he can never equal, be it in goodness, or be it in power.\"\\n\\nThe instant David discovered that he battled with a disputant who\\nimbibed his faith from the lights of nature, eschewing all subtleties of\\ndoctrine, he willingly abandoned a controversy from which he believed\\nneither profit nor credit was to be derived. While the scout was\\nspeaking, he had also seated himself, and producing the ready little\\nvolume and the iron-rimmed spectacles, he prepared to discharge a duty,\\nwhich nothing but the unexpected assault he had received in his\\northodoxy could have so long suspended. He was, in truth, a minstrel of\\nthe western continent--of a much later day, certainly, than those gifted\\nbards, who formerly sang the profane renown of baron and prince, but\\nafter the spirit of his own age and country; and he was now prepared to\\nexercise the cunning of his craft, in celebration of, or rather in\\nthanksgiving for, the recent victory. He waited patiently for Hawkeye to\\ncease, then lifting his eyes, together with his voice, he said, aloud,--\\n\\n\"I invite you, friends, to join in praise for this signal deliverance\\nfrom the hands of barbarians and infidels, to the comfortable and solemn\\ntones of the tune, called \\'Northampton.\\'\"\\n\\nHe next named the page and verse where the rhymes selected were to be\\nfound, and applied the pitch-pipe to his lips, with the decent gravity\\nthat he had been wont to use in the temple. This time he was, however,\\nwithout any accompaniment, for the sisters were just then pouring out\\nthose tender effusions of affection which have been already alluded to.\\nNothing deterred by the smallness of his audience, which, in truth,\\nconsisted only of the discontented scout, he raised his voice,\\ncommencing and ending the sacred song without accident or interruption\\nof any kind.\\n\\nHawkeye listened, while he coolly adjusted his flint and reloaded his\\nrifle; but the sounds, wanting the extraneous assistance of scene and\\nsympathy, failed to awaken his slumbering emotions. Never minstrel, or\\nby whatever more suitable name David should be known, drew upon his\\ntalents in the presence of more insensible auditors; though considering\\nthe singleness and sincerity of his motive, it is probable that no bard\\nof profane song ever uttered notes that ascended so near to that throne\\nwhere all homage and praise is due. The scout shook his head, and\\nmuttering some unintelligible words, among which \"throat\" and\\n\"Iroquois,\" were alone audible, he walked away, to collect, and to\\nexamine into, the state of the captured arsenal of the Hurons. In this\\noffice he was now joined by Chingachgook, who found his own, as well as\\nthe rifle of his son, among the arms. Even Heyward and David were\\nfurnished with weapons; nor was ammunition wanting to render them all\\neffectual.\\n\\nWhen the foresters had made their selection, and distributed their\\nprizes, the scout announced that the hour had arrived when it was\\nnecessary to move. By this time the song of Gamut had ceased, and the\\nsisters had learned to still the exhibition of their emotions. Aided by\\nDuncan and the younger Mohican, the two latter descended the precipitous\\nsides of that hill which they had so lately ascended under so very\\ndifferent auspices, and whose summit had so nearly proved the scene of\\ntheir massacre. At the foot, they found the Narragansetts browsing the\\nherbage of the bushes; and having mounted, they followed the movements\\nof a guide, who, in the most deadly straits, had so often proved himself\\ntheir friend. The journey was, however, short. Hawkeye, leaving the\\nblind path that the Hurons had followed, turned short to his right, and\\nentering the thicket, he crossed a babbling brook, and halted in a\\nnarrow dell, under the shade of a few water elms. Their distance from\\nthe base of the fatal hill was but a few rods, and the steeds had been\\nserviceable only in crossing the shallow stream.\\n\\nThe scout and the Indians appeared to be familiar with the sequestered\\nplace where they now were; for, leaning their rifles against the trees,\\nthey commenced throwing aside the dried leaves, and opening the blue\\nclay, out of which a clear and sparkling spring of bright, glancing\\nwater, quickly bubbled. The white man then looked about him, as though\\nseeking for some object, which was not to be found as readily as he\\nexpected:--\\n\\n\"Them careless imps, the Mohawks, with their Tuscarora and Onondaga\\nbrethren, have been here slaking their thirst,\" he muttered, \"and the\\nvagabonds have thrown away the gourd! This is the way with benefits,\\nwhen they are bestowed on such disremembering hounds! Here has the Lord\\nlaid his hand, in the midst of the howling wilderness, for their good,\\nand raised a fountain of water from the bowels of the \\'arth, that might\\nlaugh at the richest shop of apothecary\\'s ware in all the colonies; and\\nsee! the knaves have trodden in the clay, and deformed the cleanliness\\nof the place, as though they were brute beasts, instead of human men.\"\\n\\nUncas silently extended towards him the desired gourd, which the spleen\\nof Hawkeye had hitherto prevented him from observing, on a branch of an\\nelm. Filling it with water, he retired a short distance, to a place\\nwhere the ground was more firm and dry; here he coolly seated himself,\\nand after taking a long, and, apparently, a grateful draught, he\\ncommenced a very strict examination of the fragments of food left by the\\nHurons, which had hung in a wallet on his arm.\\n\\n\"Thank you, lad!\" he continued, returning the empty gourd to Uncas; \"now\\nwe will see how these rampaging Hurons lived, when outlying in\\nambushments. Look at this! The varlets know the better pieces of the\\ndeer; and one would think they might carve and roast a saddle, equal to\\nthe best cook in the land! But everything is raw, for the Iroquois are\\nthorough savages. Uncas, take my steel, and kindle a fire; a mouthful of\\na tender broil will give natur\\' a helping hand, after so long a trail.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that their guides now set about their repast in\\nsober earnest, assisted the ladies to alight, and placed himself at\\ntheir side, not unwilling to enjoy a few moments of grateful rest, after\\nthe bloody scene he had just gone through. While the culinary process\\nwas in hand, curiosity induced him to inquire into the circumstances\\nwhich had led to their timely and unexpected rescue:--\\n\\n\"How is it that we see you so soon, my generous friend,\" he asked, \"and\\nwithout aid from the garrison of Edward?\"\\n\\n\"Had we gone to the bend in the river, we might have been in time to\\nrake the leaves over your bodies, but too late to have saved your\\nscalps,\" coolly answered the scout. \"No, no; instead of throwing away\\nstrength and opportunity by crossing to the fort, we lay by, under the\\nbank of the Hudson, waiting to watch the movements of the Hurons.\"\\n\\n\"You were, then, witnesses of all that passed?\"\\n\\n\"Not of all; for Indian sight is too keen to be easily cheated, and we\\nkept close. A difficult matter it was, too, to keep this Mohican boy\\nsnug in the ambushment. Ah! Uncas, Uncas, your behavior was more like\\nthat of a curious woman than of a warrior on his scent.\"\\n\\nUncas permitted his eyes to turn for an instant on the sturdy\\ncountenance of the speaker, but he neither spoke nor gave any indication\\nof repentance. On the contrary, Heyward thought the manner of the young\\nMohican was disdainful, if not a little fierce, and that he suppressed\\npassions that were ready to explode, as much in compliment to the\\nlisteners, as from the deference he usually paid to his white associate.\\n\\n\"You saw our capture?\" Heyward next demanded.\\n\\n\"We heard it,\" was the significant answer. \"An Indian yell is plain\\nlanguage to men who have passed their days in the woods. But when you\\nlanded, we were driven to crawl, like sarpents, beneath the leaves; and\\nthen we lost sight of you entirely, until we placed eyes on you again,\\ntrussed to the trees, and ready bound for an Indian massacre.\"\\n\\n\"Our rescue was the deed of Providence. It was nearly a miracle that you\\ndid not mistake the path, for the Hurons divided, and each band had its\\nhorses.\"\\n\\n\"Ay! there we were thrown off the scent, and might, indeed, have lost\\nthe trail, had it not been for Uncas; we took the path, however, that\\nled into the wilderness; for we judged, and judged rightly, that the\\nsavages would hold that course with their prisoners. But when we had\\nfollowed it for many miles, without finding a single twig broken, as I\\nhad advised, my mind misgave me; especially as all the footsteps had the\\nprints of moccasins.\"\\n\\n\"Our captors had the precaution to see us shod like themselves,\" said\\nDuncan, raising a foot, and exhibiting the buckskin he wore.\\n\\n\"Ay, \\'twas judgmatical, and like themselves; though we were too expart\\nto be thrown from a trail by so common an invention.\"\\n\\n\"To what, then, are we indebted for our safety?\"\\n\\n\"To what, as a white man who has no taint of Indian blood, I should be\\nashamed to own; to the judgment of the young Mohican, in matters which I\\nshould know better than he, but which I can now hardly believe to be\\ntrue, though my own eyes tell me it is so.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis extraordinary! will you not name the reason?\"\\n\\n\"Uncas was bold enough to say, that the beasts ridden by the gentle\\nones,\" continued Hawkeye, glancing his eyes, not without curious\\ninterest, on the fillies of the ladies, \"planted the legs of one side on\\nthe ground at the same time, which is contrary to the movements of all\\ntrotting four-footed animals of my knowledge, except the bear. And yet\\nhere are horses that always journey in this manner, as my own eyes have\\nseen, and as their trail has shown for twenty long miles.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the merit of the animal! They come from the shores of\\nNarragansett Bay, in the small province of Providence Plantations, and\\nare celebrated for their hardihood, and the ease of this peculiar\\nmovement; though other horses are not unfrequently trained to the same.\"\\n\\n\"It may be--it may be,\" said Hawkeye, who had listened with singular\\nattention to this explanation; \"though I am a man who has the full blood\\nof the whites, my judgment in deer and beaver is greater than in beasts\\nof burden. Major Effingham has many noble chargers, but I have never\\nseen one travel after such a sideling gait.\"\\n\\n\"True; for he would value the animals for very different properties.\\nStill is this a breed highly esteemed, and as you witness, much honored\\nwith the burdens it is often destined to bear.\"\\n\\nThe Mohicans had suspended their operations about the glimmering fire,\\nto listen; and when Duncan had done, they looked at each other\\nsignificantly, the father uttering the never-failing exclamation of\\nsurprise. The scout ruminated, like a man digesting his newly acquired\\nknowledge, and once more stole a curious glance at the horses.\\n\\n\"I dare to say there are even stranger sights to be seen in the\\nsettlements!\" he said, at length; \"natur\\' is sadly abused by man, when\\nhe once gets the mastery. But, go sideling or go straight, Uncas had\\nseen the movement, and their trail led us on to the broken bush. The\\nouter branch, near the prints of one of the horses, was bent upward, as\\na lady breaks a flower from its stem, but all the rest were ragged and\\nbroken down, as if the strong hand of a man had been tearing them! So I\\nconcluded that the cunning varmints had seen the twig bent, and had torn\\nthe rest, to make us believe a buck had been feeling the boughs with his\\nantlers.\"\\n\\n\"I do believe your sagacity did not deceive you; for some such thing\\noccurred!\"\\n\\n\"That was easy to see,\" added the scout, in no degree conscious of\\nhaving exhibited any extraordinary sagacity; \"and a very different\\nmatter it was from a waddling horse! It then struck me the Mingos would\\npush for this spring, for the knaves well know the vartue of its\\nwaters!\"\\n\\n\"Is it, then, so famous?\" demanded Heyward, examining, with a more\\ncurious eye, the secluded dell, with its bubbling fountain, surrounded,\\nas it was, by earth of a deep dingy brown.\\n\\n\"Few redskins, who travel south and east of the great lakes, but have\\nheard of its qualities. Will you taste for yourself?\"\\n\\nHeyward took the gourd, and after swallowing a little of the water,\\nthrew it aside with grimaces of discontent. The scout laughed in his\\nsilent, but heartfelt manner, and shook his head with vast satisfaction.\\n\\n\"Ah! you want the flavor that one gets by habit; the time was when I\\nliked it as little as yourself; but I have come to my taste, and I now\\ncrave it, as a deer does the licks.[17] Your high spiced wines are not\\nbetter liked than a redskin relishes this water; especially when his\\nnatur\\' is ailing. But Uncas has made his fire, and it is time we think\\nof eating, for our journey is long, and all before us.\"\\n\\nInterrupting the dialogue by this abrupt transition, the scout had\\ninstant recourse to the fragments of food which had escaped the voracity\\nof the Hurons. A very summary process completed the simple cookery, when\\nhe and the Mohicans commenced their humble meal, with the silence and\\ncharacteristic diligence of men who ate in order to enable themselves\\nto endure great and unremitting toil.\\n\\nWhen this necessary, and, happily, grateful duty had been performed,\\neach of the foresters stooped and took a long and parting draught at\\nthat solitary and silent spring,[18] around which and its sister\\nfountains, within fifty years, the wealth, beauty, and talents of a\\nhemisphere were to assemble in throngs, in pursuit of health and\\npleasure. Then Hawkeye announced his determination to proceed. The\\nsisters resumed their saddles; Duncan and David grasped their rifles,\\nand followed on their footsteps; the scout leading the advance, and the\\nMohicans bringing up the rear. The whole party moved swiftly through the\\nnarrow path, towards the north, leaving the healing waters to mingle\\nunheeded with the adjacent brook, and the bodies of the dead to fester\\non the neighboring mount, without the rites of sepulture; a fate but too\\ncommon to the warriors of the woods to excite either commiseration or\\ncomment.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n  \"Then go we in, to know his embassy;\\n  Which I could, with ready guess, declare,\\n  Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.\"\\n\\n  _King Henry V._\\n\\n\\nA few succeeding days were passed amid the privations, the uproar, and\\nthe dangers of the siege, which was vigorously pressed by a power\\nagainst whose approaches Munro possessed no competent means of\\nresistance. It appeared as if Webb, with his army, which lay slumbering\\non the banks of the Hudson, had utterly forgotten the strait to which\\nhis countrymen were reduced. Montcalm had filled the woods of the\\nportage with his savages, every yell and whoop from whom rang through\\nthe British encampment, chilling the hearts of men who were already but\\ntoo much disposed to magnify the danger.\\n\\nNot so, however, with the besieged. Animated by the words, and\\nstimulated by the examples, of their leaders, they had found their\\ncourage, and maintained their ancient reputation, with zeal that did\\njustice to the stern character of their commander. As if satisfied with\\nthe toil of marching through the wilderness to encounter his enemy, the\\nFrench general, though of approved skill, had neglected to seize the\\nadjacent mountains; whence the besieged might have been exterminated\\nwith impunity, and which, in the more modern warfare of the country,\\nwould not have been neglected for a single hour. This sort of contempt\\nfor eminences, or rather dread of the labor of ascending them, might\\nhave been termed the besetting weakness of the warfare of the period. It\\noriginated in the simplicity of the Indian contests, in which, from the\\nnature of the combats, and the density of the forests, fortresses were\\nrare, and artillery next to useless. The carelessness engendered by\\nthese usages descended even to the war of the Revolution, and lost the\\nStates the important fortress of Ticonderoga, opening a way for the army\\nof Burgoyne into what was then the bosom of the country. We look back at\\nthis ignorance, or infatuation, whichever it may be called, with wonder,\\nknowing that the neglect of an eminence, whose difficulties, like those\\nof Mount Defiance, have been so greatly exaggerated, would, at the\\npresent time, prove fatal to the reputation of the engineer who had\\nplanned the works at their base, or to that of the general whose lot it\\nwas to defend them.\\n\\nThe tourist, the valetudinarian, or the amateur of the beauties of\\nnature, who, in the train of his four-in-hand, now rolls through the\\nscenes we have attempted to describe, in quest of information, health,\\nor pleasure, or floats steadily towards his object on those artificial\\nwaters which have sprung up under the administration of a statesman[21]\\nwho has dared to stake his political character on the hazardous issue,\\nis not to suppose that his ancestors traversed those hills, or struggled\\nwith the same currents with equal facility. The transportation of a\\nsingle heavy gun was often considered equal to a victory gained; if,\\nhappily, the difficulties of the passage had not so far separated it\\nfrom its necessary concomitant, the ammunition, as to render it no more\\nthan an useless tube of unwieldy iron.\\n\\nThe evils of this state of things pressed heavily on the fortunes of the\\nresolute Scotsman who now defended William Henry. Though his adversary\\nneglected the hills, he had planted his batteries with judgment on the\\nplain, and caused them to be served with vigor and skill. Against this\\nassault, the besieged could only oppose the imperfect and hasty\\npreparations of a fortress in the wilderness.\\n\\nIt was in the afternoon of the fifth day of the siege, and the fourth of\\nhis own service in it, that Major Heyward profited by a parley that had\\njust been beaten, by repairing to the ramparts of one of the water\\nbastions, to breathe the cool air from the lake, and to take a survey of\\nthe progress of the siege. He was alone, if the solitary sentinel who\\npaced the mound be excepted; for the artillerists had hastened also to\\nprofit by the temporary suspension of their arduous duties. The evening\\nwas delightfully calm, and the light air from the limpid water fresh and\\nsoothing. It seemed as if, with the termination to the roar of artillery\\nand the plunging of shot, nature had also seized the moment to assume\\nher mildest and most captivating form. The sun poured down his parting\\nglory on the scene, without the oppression of those fierce rays that\\nbelong to the climate and the season. The mountains looked green and\\nfresh and lovely; tempered with the milder light, or softened in shadow,\\nas thin vapors floated between them and the sun. The numerous islands\\nrested on the bosom of the Horican, some low and sunken, as if imbedded\\nin the waters, and others appearing to hover above the element, in\\nlittle hillocks of green velvet; among which the fishermen of the\\nbeleaguering army peacefully rowed their skiffs, or floated at rest on\\nthe glassy mirror, in quiet pursuit of their employment.\\n\\nThe scene was at once animated and still. All that pertained to nature\\nwas sweet, or simply grand; while those parts which depended on the\\ntemper and movements of man were lively and playful.\\n\\nTwo little spotless flags were abroad, the one on a salient angle of the\\nfort, and the other on the advanced battery of the besiegers; emblems of\\nthe truce which existed, not only to the acts, but it would seem, also,\\nto the enmity of the combatants.\\n\\nBehind these, again, swung, heavily opening and closing in silken folds,\\nthe rival standards of England and France.\\n\\nA hundred gay and thoughtless young Frenchmen were drawing a net to the\\npebbly beach, within dangerous proximity to the sullen but silent cannon\\nof the fort, while the eastern mountain was sending back the loud shouts\\nand gay merriment that attended their sport. Some were rushing eagerly\\nto enjoy the aquatic games of the lake, and others were already toiling\\ntheir way up the neighboring hills, with the restless curiosity of their\\nnation. To all these sports and pursuits, those of the enemy who watched\\nthe besieged, and the besieged themselves, were, however, merely the\\nidle, though sympathizing spectators. Here and there a picket had,\\nindeed, raised a song, or mingled in a dance, which had drawn the dusky\\nsavages around them, from their lairs in the forest. In short,\\neverything wore rather the appearance of a day of pleasure, than of an\\nhour stolen from the dangers and toil of a bloody and vindictive\\nwarfare.\\n\\nDuncan had stood in a musing attitude, contemplating this scene a few\\nminutes, when his eyes were directed to the glacis in front of the\\nsally-port already mentioned, by the sounds of approaching footsteps. He\\nwalked to an angle of the bastion, and beheld the scout advancing, under\\nthe custody of a French officer, to the body of the fort. The\\ncountenance of Hawkeye was haggard and careworn, and his air dejected,\\nas though he felt the deepest degradation at having fallen into the\\npower of his enemies. He was without his favorite weapon, and his arms\\nwere even bound behind him with thongs, made of the skin of a deer. The\\narrival of flags, to cover the messengers of summons, had occurred so\\noften of late, that when Heyward first threw his careless glance on this\\ngroup, he expected to see another of the officers of the enemy, charged\\nwith a similar office; but the instant he recognized the tall person,\\nand still sturdy, though downcast features of his friend the woodsman,\\nhe started with surprise, and turned to descend from the bastion into\\nthe bosom of the work.\\n\\nThe sounds of other voices, however, caught his attention, and for a\\nmoment caused him to forget his purpose. At the inner angle of the mound\\nhe met the sisters, walking along the parapet in search, like himself,\\nof air and relief from confinement. They had not met from that painful\\nmoment when he deserted them on the plain, only to assure their safety.\\nHe had parted from them worn with care, and jaded with fatigue; he now\\nsaw them refreshed and blooming, though timid and anxious. Under such an\\ninducement, it will cause no surprise that the young man lost sight, for\\na time, of other objects in order to address them. He was, however,\\nanticipated by the voice of the ingenuous and youthful Alice.\\n\\n\"Ah! thou truant! thou recreant knight! he who abandons his damsels in\\nthe very lists!\" she cried; \"here have we been days, nay, ages,\\nexpecting you at our feet, imploring mercy and forgetfulness of your\\ncraven backsliding, or, I should rather say, back-running--for verily\\nyou fled in a manner that no stricken deer, as our worthy friend the\\nscout would say, could equal!\"\\n\\n\"You know that Alice means our thanks and our blessings,\" added the\\ngraver and more thoughtful Cora. \"In truth, we have a little wondered\\nwhy you should so rigidly absent yourself from a place where the\\ngratitude of the daughters might receive the support of a parent\\'s\\nthanks.\"\\n\\n\"Your father himself could tell you, that though absent from your\\npresence, I have not been altogether forgetful of your safety,\" returned\\nthe young man; \"the mastery of yonder village of huts,\" pointing to the\\nneighboring entrenched camp, \"has been keenly disputed; and he who holds\\nit is sure to be possessed of this fort, and that which it contains. My\\ndays and my nights have all been passed there since we separated,\\nbecause I thought that duty called me thither. But,\" he added with an\\nair of chagrin, which he endeavored, though unsuccessfully, to conceal,\\n\"had I been aware that what I then believed a soldier\\'s conduct could so\\nbe construed, shame would have been added to the list of reasons.\"\\n\\n\"Heyward!--Duncan!\" exclaimed Alice, bending forward to read his\\nhalf-averted countenance, until a lock of her golden hair rested on her\\nflushed cheek, and nearly concealed the tear that had started to her\\neye; \"did I think this idle tongue of mine had pained you, I would\\nsilence it forever, Cora can say, if Cora would, how justly we have\\nprized your services, and how deep--I had almost said, how fervent--is\\nour gratitude.\"\\n\\n\"And will Cora attest the truth of this?\" cried Duncan, suffering the\\ncloud to be chased from his countenance by a smile of open pleasure.\\n\"What says our graver sister? Will she find an excuse for the neglect of\\nthe knight in the duty of a soldier?\"\\n\\nCora made no immediate answer, but turned her face towards the water, as\\nif looking on the sheet of the Horican. When she did bend her dark eyes\\non the young man, they were yet filled with an expression of anguish\\nthat at once drove every thought but that of kind solicitude from his\\nmind.\\n\\n\"You are not well, dearest Miss Munro!\" he exclaimed; \"we have trifled\\nwhile you are in suffering.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis nothing,\" she answered, refusing his offered support with feminine\\nreserve. \"That I cannot see the sunny side of the picture of life, like\\nthis artless but ardent enthusiast,\" she added, laying her hand lightly,\\nbut affectionately, on the arm of her sister, \"is the penalty of\\nexperience, and, perhaps, the misfortune of my nature. See,\" she\\ncontinued, as if determined to shake off infirmity, in a sense of duty;\\n\"look around you, Major Heyward, and tell me what a prospect is this for\\nthe daughter of a soldier whose greatest happiness is his honor and his\\nmilitary renown.\"\\n\\n\"Neither ought nor shall be tarnished by circumstances over which he has\\nhad no control,\" Duncan warmly replied. \"But your words recall me to my\\nown duty. I go now to your gallant father, to hear his determination in\\nmatters of the last moment to the defence. God bless you in every\\nfortune, noble--Cora--I may and must call you.\" She frankly gave him her\\nhand, though her lip quivered, and her cheeks gradually became of an\\nashy paleness. \"In every fortune, I know you will be an ornament and\\nhonor to your sex. Alice, adieu\"--his tone changed from admiration to\\ntenderness--\"adieu, Alice; we shall soon meet again; as conquerors, I\\ntrust, and amid rejoicings!\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for an answer from either, the young man threw himself\\ndown the grassy steps of the bastion, and moving rapidly across the\\nparade, he was quickly in the presence of their father. Munro was\\npacing his narrow apartment with a disturbed air and gigantic strides as\\nDuncan entered.\\n\\n\"You have anticipated my wishes, Major Heyward,\" he said; \"I was about\\nto request this favor.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to see, sir, that the messenger I so warmly recommended has\\nreturned in custody of the French! I hope there is no reason to distrust\\nhis fidelity?\"\\n\\n\"The fidelity of \\'The Long Rifle\\' is well known to me,\" returned Munro,\\n\"and is above suspicion; though his usual good fortune seems, at last,\\nto have failed. Montcalm has got him, and with the accursed politeness\\nof his nation, he has sent him in with a doleful tale, of \\'knowing how I\\nvalued the fellow, he could not think of retaining him.\\' A Jesuitical\\nway, that, Major Duncan Heyward, of telling a man of his misfortunes!\"\\n\\n\"But the general and his succor?\"\\n\\n\"Did ye look to the south as ye entered, and could ye not see them?\"\\nsaid the old soldier, laughing bitterly. \"Hoot! hoot! you\\'re an\\nimpatient boy, sir, and cannot give the gentlemen leisure for their\\nmarch!\"\\n\\n\"They are coming, then? The scout has said as much?\"\\n\\n\"When? and by what path? for the dunce has omitted to tell me this.\\nThere is a letter, it would seem, too; and that is the only agreeable\\npart of the matter. For the customary attentions of your Marquis of\\nMontcalm--I warrant me, Duncan, that he of Lothian would buy a dozen\\nsuch marquisates--but, if the news of the letter were bad, the gentility\\nof this French monsieur would certainly compel him to let us know it.\"\\n\\n\"He keeps the letter, then, while he releases the messenger!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, that does he, and all for the sake of what you call your\\n\\'_bonhommie_,\\' I would venture, if the truth was known, the fellow\\'s\\ngrandfather taught the noble science of dancing.\"\\n\\n\"But what says the scout? he has eyes and ears, and a tongue: what\\nverbal report does he make?\"\\n\\n\"O! sir, he is not wanting in natural organs, and he is free to tell all\\nthat he has seen and heard. The whole amount is this: there is a fort of\\nhis majesty\\'s on the banks of the Hudson, called Edward, in honor of his\\ngracious highness of York, you\\'ll know; and it is well filled with armed\\nmen, as such a work should be.\"\\n\\n\"But was there no movement, no signs of any intention to advance to our\\nrelief?\"\\n\\n\"There were the morning and evening parades; and when one of the\\nprovincial loons--you\\'ll know, Duncan, you\\'re half a Scotsman\\nyourself--when one of them dropped his powder over his porretch, if it\\ntouched the coals, it just burnt!\" Then suddenly changing his bitter,\\nironical manner, to one more grave and thoughtful, he continued; \"and\\nyet there might, and must be, something in that letter which it would be\\nwell to know!\"\\n\\n\"Our decision should be speedy,\" said Duncan, gladly availing himself of\\nthis change of humor, to press the more important objects of their\\ninterview; \"I cannot conceal from you, sir, that the camp will not be\\nmuch longer tenable; and I am sorry to add, that things appear no better\\nin the fort; more than half the guns are bursted.\"\\n\\n\"And how should it be otherwise? Some were fished from the bottom of the\\nlake; some have been rusting in the woods since the discovery of the\\ncountry; and some were never guns at all--mere privateersmen\\'s\\nplaythings! Do you think, sir, you can have Woolwich Warren in the midst\\nof a wilderness, three thousand miles from Great Britain!\"\\n\\n\"The walls are crumbling about our ears, and provisions begin to fail\\nus,\" continued Heyward, without regarding this new burst of indignation;\\n\"even the men show signs of discontent and alarm.\"\\n\\n\"Major Heyward,\" said Munro, turning to his youthful associate with the\\ndignity of his years and superior rank; \"I should have served his\\nmajesty for half a century, and earned these gray hairs, in vain, were I\\nignorant of all you say, and of the pressing nature of our\\ncircumstances; still, there is everything due to the honor of the king\\'s\\narms and something to ourselves. While there is hope of succor, this\\nfortress will I defend, though it be to be done with pebbles gathered on\\nthe lake shore. It is a sight of the letter, therefore, that we want,\\nthat we may know the intentions of the man the Earl of Loudon has left\\namong us as his substitute.\"\\n\\n\"And can I be of service in the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Sir, you can; the Marquis of Montcalm has, in addition to his other\\ncivilities, invited me to a personal interview between the works and his\\nown camp; in order, as he says, to impart some additional information.\\nNow, I think it would not be wise to show any undue solicitude to meet\\nhim, and I would employ you, an officer of rank, as my substitute; for\\nit would but ill comport with the honor of Scotland to let it be said\\none of her gentlemen was outdone in civility by a native of any other\\ncountry on earth.\"\\n\\nWithout assuming the supererogatory task of entering into a discussion\\nof the comparative merits of national courtesy, Duncan cheerfully\\nassented to supply the place of the veteran in the approaching\\ninterview. A long and confidential communication now succeeded, during\\nwhich the young man received some additional insight into his duty, from\\nthe experience and native acuteness of his commander, and then the\\nformer took his leave.\\n\\nAs Duncan could only act as the representative of the commandant of the\\nfort, the ceremonies which should have accompanied a meeting between the\\nheads of the adverse forces were of course dispensed with. The truce\\nstill existed, and with a roll and beat of the drum, and covered by a\\nlittle white flag, Duncan left the sally-port, within ten minutes after\\nhis instructions were ended. He was received by the French officer in\\nadvance with the usual formalities, and immediately accompanied to a\\ndistant marquee of the renowned soldier who led the forces of France.\\n\\nThe general of the enemy received the youthful messenger, surrounded by\\nhis principal officers, and by a swarthy band of the native chiefs, who\\nhad followed him to the field, with the warriors of their several\\ntribes. Heyward paused short, when, in glancing his eyes rapidly over\\nthe dark group of the latter, he beheld the malignant countenance of\\nMagua, regarding him with the calm but sullen attention which marked the\\nexpression of that subtle savage. A slight exclamation of surprise even\\nburst from the lips of the young man; but instantly recollecting his\\nerrand, and the presence in which he stood, he suppressed every\\nappearance of emotion, and turned to the hostile leader, who had already\\nadvanced a step to receive him.\\n\\nThe Marquis of Montcalm was, at the period of which we write, in the\\nflower of his age, and, it may be added, in the zenith of his fortunes.\\nBut, even in that enviable situation, he was affable, and distinguished\\nas much for his attention to the forms of courtesy, as for that\\nchivalrous courage which, only two short years afterwards, induced him\\nto throw away his life on the plains of Abraham. Duncan, in turning his\\neyes from the malign expression of Magua, suffered them to rest with\\npleasure on the smiling and polished features, and the noble military\\nair, of the French general.\\n\\n\"Monsieur,\" said the latter, \"j\\'ai beaucoup de plaisir a--bah!--ou est\\ncet interprete?\"\\n\\n\"Je crois, monsieur, qu\\'il ne sera pas necessaire,\" Heyward modestly\\nreplied; \"je parle un peu Francais.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! j\\'en suis bien aise,\" said Montcalm, taking Duncan familiarly by\\nthe arm, and leading him deep into the marquee, a little out of\\near-shot; \"je deteste ces fripons-la; on ne sait jamais sur quel pie on\\nest avec eux. Eh, bien! monsieur,\" he continued, still speaking in\\nFrench; \"though I should have been proud of receiving your commandant, I\\nam very happy that he has seen proper to employ an officer so\\ndistinguished, and who, I am sure, is so amiable, as yourself.\"\\n\\nDuncan bowed low, pleased with the compliment, in spite of a most heroic\\ndetermination to suffer no artifice to allure him into forgetfulness of\\nthe interest of his prince; and Montcalm, after a pause of a moment, as\\nif to recollect his thoughts, proceeded,--\\n\\n\"Your commandant is a brave man, and well qualified to repel my assault.\\nMais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of\\nhumanity, and less of your courage? The one as strongly characterizes\\nthe hero as the other.\"\\n\\n\"We consider the qualities as inseparable,\" returned Duncan, smiling;\\n\"but while we find in the vigor of your excellency every motive to\\nstimulate the one, we can, as yet, see no particular call for the\\nexercise of the other.\"\\n\\nMontcalm, in his turn, slightly bowed, but it was with the air of a man\\ntoo practised to remember the language of flattery. After musing a\\nmoment, he added,--\\n\\n\"It is possible my glasses have deceived me, and that your works resist\\nour cannon better than I had supposed. You know our force?\"\\n\\n\"Our accounts vary,\" said Duncan, carelessly; \"the highest, however, has\\nnot exceeded twenty thousand men.\"\\n\\nThe Frenchman bit his lip, and fastened his eyes keenly on the other as\\nif to read his thoughts; then, with a readiness peculiar to himself, he\\ncontinued, as if assenting to the truth of an enumeration which quite\\ndoubled his army,--\\n\\n\"It is a poor compliment to the vigilance of us soldiers, monsieur,\\nthat, do what we will, we never can conceal our numbers. If it were to\\nbe done at all, one would believe it might succeed in these woods.\\nThough you think it too soon to listen to the calls of humanity,\" he\\nadded, smiling archly, \"I may be permitted to believe that gallantry is\\nnot forgotten by one so young as yourself. The daughters of the\\ncommandant, I learn, have passed into the fort since it was invested?\"\\n\\n\"It is true, monsieur; but, so far from weakening our efforts, they set\\nus an example of courage in their own fortitude. Were nothing but\\nresolution necessary to repel so accomplished a soldier as M. de\\nMontcalm, I would gladly trust the defence of William Henry to the elder\\nof those ladies.\"\\n\\n\"We have a wise ordinance in our Salique laws, which says, \\'The crown of\\nFrance shall never degrade the lance to the distaff,\\'\" said Montcalm,\\ndryly, and with a little hauteur; but instantly adding, with his former\\nfrank and easy air, \"as all the nobler qualities are hereditary, I can\\neasily credit you; though, as I said before, courage has its limits, and\\nhumanity must not be forgotten. I trust, monsieur, you come authorized\\nto treat for the surrender of the place?\"\\n\\n\"Has your excellency found our defence so feeble as to believe the\\nmeasure necessary?\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry to have the defence protracted in such a manner as to\\nirritate my red friends there,\" continued Montcalm, glancing his eyes at\\nthe group of grave and attentive Indians, without attending to the\\nother\\'s question; \"I find it difficult, even now, to limit them to the\\nusages of war.\"\\n\\nHeyward was silent; for a painful recollection of the dangers he had so\\nrecently escaped came over his mind, and recalled the images of those\\ndefenceless beings who had shared in all his sufferings.\\n\\n\"Ces messieurs-la,\" said Montcalm, following up the advantage which he\\nconceived he had gained, \"are most formidable when baffled: and it is\\nunnecessary to tell you with what difficulty they are restrained in\\ntheir anger. Eh bien, monsieur! shall we speak of the terms?\"\\n\\n\"I fear your excellency has been deceived as to the strength of William\\nHenry, and the resources of its garrison!\"\\n\\n\"I have not sat down before Quebec, but an earthen work, that is\\ndefended by twenty-three hundred gallant men,\" was the laconic reply.\\n\\n\"Our mounds are earthen, certainly--nor are they seated on the rocks of\\nCape Diamond; but they stand on that shore which proved so destructive\\nto Dieskau and his army. There is also a powerful force within a few\\nhours\\' march of us, which we account upon as part of our means.\"\\n\\n\"Some six or eight thousand men,\" returned Montcalm, with much apparent\\nindifference, \"whom their leader wisely judges to be safer in their\\nworks than in the field.\"\\n\\nIt was now Heyward\\'s turn to bite his lip with vexation, as the other so\\ncoolly alluded to a force which the young man knew to be overrated. Both\\nmused a little while in silence, when Montcalm renewed the conversation,\\nin a way that showed he believed the visit of his guest was solely to\\npropose terms of capitulation. On the other hand, Heyward began to throw\\nsundry inducements in the way of the French general, to betray the\\ndiscoveries he had made through the intercepted letter. The artifice of\\nneither, however, succeeded; and after a protracted and fruitless\\ninterview, Duncan took his leave, favorably impressed with an opinion of\\nthe courtesy and talents of the enemy\\'s captain, but as ignorant of what\\nhe came to learn as when he arrived. Montcalm followed him as far as the\\nentrance of the marquee, renewing his invitations to the commandant of\\nthe fort to give him an immediate meeting in the open ground, between\\nthe two armies.\\n\\nThere they separated, and Duncan returned to the advanced post of the\\nFrench, accompanied as before; whence he instantly proceeded to the\\nfort, and to the quarters of his own commander.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n  \"_Edg._--Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.\"\\n\\n  _King Lear._\\n\\n\\nMajor Heyward found Munro attended only by his daughters. Alice sat upon\\nhis knee, parting the gray hairs on the forehead of the old man with her\\ndelicate fingers; and, whenever he affected to frown on her trifling,\\nappeasing his assumed anger by pressing her ruby lips fondly on his\\nwrinkled brow. Cora was seated nigh them, a calm and amused looker-on;\\nregarding the wayward movements of her more youthful sister, with that\\nspecies of maternal fondness which characterized her love for Alice. Not\\nonly the dangers through which they had passed, but those which still\\nimpended above them, appeared to be momentarily forgotten, in the\\nsoothing indulgence of such a family meeting. It seemed as if they had\\nprofited by the short truce, to devote an instant to the purest and best\\naffections: the daughters forgetting their fears, and the veteran his\\ncares, in the security of the moment. Of this scene, Duncan, who in his\\neagerness to report his arrival had entered unannounced, stood many\\nmoments an unobserved and a delighted spectator. But the quick and\\ndancing eyes of Alice soon caught a glimpse of his figure reflected from\\na glass, and she sprang blushing from her father\\'s knee, exclaiming\\naloud,--\\n\\n\"Major Heyward!\"\\n\\n\"What of the lad?\" demanded the father; \"I have sent him to crack a\\nlittle with the Frenchman. Ha! sir, you are young, and you\\'re nimble!\\nAway with you, ye baggage; as if there were not troubles enough for a\\nsoldier, without having his camp filled with such prattling hussies as\\nyourself!\"\\n\\nAlice laughingly followed her sister, who instantly led the way from an\\napartment where she perceived their presence was no longer desirable.\\nMunro, instead of demanding the result of the young man\\'s mission, paced\\nthe room for a few moments, with his hands behind his back, and his head\\ninclined towards the floor, like a man lost in thought. At length he\\nraised his eyes, glistening with a father\\'s fondness, and exclaimed,--\\n\\n\"They are a pair of excellent girls, Heyward, and such as any one may\\nboast of.\"\\n\\n\"You are not now to learn my opinion of your daughters, Colonel Munro.\"\\n\\n\"True, lad, true,\" interrupted the impatient old man; \"you were about\\nopening your mind more fully on that matter the day you got in; but I\\ndid not think it becoming in an old soldier to be talking of nuptial\\nblessings and wedding jokes when the enemies of his king were likely to\\nbe unbidden guests at the feast! But I was wrong, Duncan, boy, I was\\nwrong there; and I am now ready to hear what you have to say.\"\\n\\n\"Notwithstanding the pleasure your assurance gives me, dear sir, I have\\njust now a message from Montcalm--\"\\n\\n\"Let the Frenchman and all his host go to the devil, sir?\" exclaimed the\\nhasty veteran. \"He is not yet master of William Henry, nor shall he ever\\nbe, provided Webb proves himself the man he should. No, sir! thank\\nHeaven, we are not yet in such a strait that it can be said Munro is too\\nmuch pressed to discharge the little domestic duties of his own family.\\nYour mother was the only child of my bosom friend, Duncan; and I\\'ll just\\ngive you a hearing, though all the knights of St. Louis were in a body\\nat the sally-port, with the French saint at their head, craving to speak\\na word under favor. A pretty degree of knighthood, sir, is that which\\ncan be bought with sugar-hogsheads! and then your two-penny marquisates!\\nThe thistle is the order for dignity and antiquity; the veritable _nemo\\nme impune lacessit_ of chivalry! Ye had ancestors in that degree,\\nDuncan, and they were an ornament to the nobles of Scotland.\"\\n\\nHeyward, who perceived that his superior took a malicious pleasure in\\nexhibiting his contempt for the message of the French general, was fain\\nto humor a spleen that he knew would be short-lived; he therefore\\nreplied with as much indifference as he could assume on such a\\nsubject,--\\n\\n\"My request, as you know, sir, went so far as to presume to the honor of\\nbeing your son.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, boy, you found words to make yourself very plainly comprehended.\\nBut, let me ask ye, sir, have you been as intelligible to the girl?\"\\n\\n\"On my honor, no,\" exclaimed Duncan, warmly; \"there would have been an\\nabuse of a confided trust, had I taken advantage of my situation for\\nsuch a purpose.\"\\n\\n\"Your notions are those of a gentleman, Major Heyward, and well enough\\nin their place. But Cora Munro is a maiden too discreet, and of a mind\\ntoo elevated and improved, to need the guardianship even of a father.\"\\n\\n\"Cora!\"\\n\\n\"Ay--Cora! we are talking of your pretensions to Miss Munro, are we not,\\nsir?\"\\n\\n\"I--I--I was not conscious of having mentioned her name,\" said Duncan,\\nstammering.\\n\\n\"And to marry whom, then, did you wish my consent, Major Heyward?\"\\ndemanded the old soldier, erecting himself in the dignity of offended\\nfeeling.\\n\\n\"You have another, and not less lovely child.\"\\n\\n\"Alice!\" exclaimed the father, in an astonishment equal to that with\\nwhich Duncan had just repeated the name of her sister.\\n\\n\"Such was the direction of my wishes, sir.\"\\n\\nThe young man awaited in silence the result of the extraordinary effect\\nproduced by a communication which, as it now appeared, was so\\nunexpected. For several minutes Munro paced the chamber with long and\\nrapid strides, his rigid features working convulsively, and every\\nfaculty seemingly absorbed in the musings of his own mind. At length, he\\npaused directly in front of Heyward, and riveting his eyes upon those of\\nthe other, he said, with a lip that quivered violently,--\\n\\n\"Duncan Heyward, I have loved you for the sake of him whose blood is in\\nyour veins; I have loved you for your own good qualities; and I have\\nloved you, because I thought you would contribute to the happiness of my\\nchild. But all this love would turn to hatred, were I assured that what\\nI so much apprehend is true.\"\\n\\n\"God forbid that any act or thought of mine should lead to such a\\nchange!\" exclaimed the young man, whose eye never quailed under the\\npenetrating look it encountered. Without adverting the impossibility of\\nthe other\\'s comprehending those feelings which were hid in his own\\nbosom, Munro suffered himself to be appeased by the unaltered\\ncountenance he met, and with a voice sensibly softened, he continued,--\\n\\n\"You would be my son, Duncan, and you\\'re ignorant of the history of the\\nman you wish to call your father. Sit ye down, young man, and I will\\nopen to you the wounds of a seared heart, in as few words as may be\\nsuitable.\"\\n\\nBy this time, the message of Montcalm was as much forgotten by him who\\nbore it as by the man for whose ears it was intended. Each drew a chair,\\nand while the veteran communed a few moments with his own thoughts,\\napparently in sadness, the youth suppressed his impatience in a look and\\nattitude of respectful attention. At length the former spoke:--\\n\\n\"You\\'ll know, already, Major Heyward, that my family was both ancient\\nand honorable,\" commenced the Scotsman; \"though it might not altogether\\nbe endowed with that amount of wealth that should correspond with its\\ndegree. I was, may be, such an one as yourself when I plighted my faith\\nto Alice Graham, the only child of a neighboring laird of some estate.\\nBut the connection was disagreeable to her father, on more accounts than\\nmy poverty. I did therefore what an honest man should--restored the\\nmaiden her troth, and departed the country in the service of my king. I\\nhad seen many regions, and had shed much blood in different lands,\\nbefore duty called me to the islands of the West Indies. There it was my\\nlot to form a connection with one who in time became my wife, and the\\nmother of Cora. She was the daughter of a gentleman of those isles, by a\\nlady whose misfortune it was, if you will,\" said the old man, proudly,\\n\"to be descended, remotely, from that unfortunate class who are so\\nbasely enslaved to administer to the wants of a luxurious people. Ay,\\nsir, that is a curse entailed on Scotland by her unnatural union with a\\nforeign and trading people. But could I find a man among them who would\\ndare to reflect on my child, he should feel the weight of a father\\'s\\nanger! Ha! Major Heyward, you are yourself born at the south, where\\nthese unfortunate beings are considered of a race inferior to your own.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis most unfortunately true, sir,\" said Duncan, unable any longer to\\nprevent his eyes from sinking to the floor in embarrassment.\\n\\n\"And you cast it on my child as a reproach! You scorn to mingle the\\nblood of the Heywards with one so degraded--lovely and virtuous though\\nshe be?\" fiercely demanded the jealous parent.\\n\\n\"Heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!\" returned\\nDuncan, at the same time conscious of such a feeling, and that as deeply\\nrooted as if it had been ingrafted in his nature. \"The sweetness, the\\nbeauty, the witchery of your younger daughter, Colonel Munro, might\\nexplain my motives, without imputing to me this injustice.\"\\n\\n\"Ye are right, sir,\" returned the old man, again changing his tones to\\nthose of gentleness, or rather softness; \"the girl is the image of what\\nher mother was at her years, and before she had become acquainted with\\ngrief. When death deprived me of my wife I returned to Scotland,\\nenriched by the marriage; and would you think it, Duncan! The suffering\\nangel had remained in the heartless state of celibacy twenty long years,\\nand that for the sake of a man who could forget her! She did more, sir;\\nshe over-looked my want of faith, and all difficulties being now\\nremoved, she took me for her husband.\"\\n\\n\"And became the mother of Alice?\" exclaimed Duncan, with an eagerness\\nthat might have proved dangerous at a moment when the thoughts of Munro\\nwere less occupied than at present.\\n\\n\"She did, indeed,\" said the old man, \"and dearly did she pay for the\\nblessing she bestowed. But she is a saint in heaven, sir; and it ill\\nbecomes one whose foot rests on the grave to mourn a lot so blessed. I\\nhad her but a single year, though; a short term of happiness for one who\\nhad seen her youth fade in hopeless pining.\"\\n\\nThere was something so commanding in the distress of the old man, that\\nHeyward did not dare to venture a syllable of consolation. Munro sat\\nutterly unconscious of the other\\'s presence, his features exposed and\\nworking with the anguish of his regrets, while heavy tears fell from his\\neyes, and rolled unheeded from his cheeks to the floor. At length he\\nmoved, as if suddenly recovering his recollection; when he arose, and\\ntaking a single turn across the room, he approached his companion with\\nan air of military grandeur, and demanded,--\\n\\n\"Have you not, Major Heyward, some communication that I should hear from\\nthe Marquis de Montcalm?\"\\n\\nDuncan started, in his turn, and immediately commenced, in an\\nembarrassed voice, the half-forgotten message. It is unnecessary to\\ndwell upon the evasive, though polite manner, with which the French\\ngeneral had eluded every attempt of Heyward to worm from him the purport\\nof the communication he had proposed making, or on the decided, though\\nstill polished message, by which he now gave his enemy to understand,\\nthat unless he chose to receive it in person, he should not receive it\\nat all. As Munro listened to the detail of Duncan, the excited feelings\\nof the father gradually gave way before the obligations of his station,\\nand when the other was done, he saw before him nothing but the veteran,\\nswelling with the wounded feelings of a soldier.\\n\\n\"You have said enough, Major Heyward!\" exclaimed the angry old man:\\n\"enough to make a volume of commentary on French civility. Here has this\\ngentleman invited me to a conference, and when I send him a capable\\nsubstitute, for ye\\'re all that, Duncan, though your years are but few,\\nhe answers me with a riddle.\"\\n\\n\"He may have thought less favorably of the substitute, my dear sir; and\\nyou will remember that the invitation, which he now repeats, was to the\\ncommandant of the works, and not to his second.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity\\nof him who grants the commission? He wishes to confer with Munro! Faith,\\nsir, I have much inclination to indulge the man, if it should only be to\\nlet him behold the firm countenance we maintain in spite of his numbers\\nand his summons. There might be no bad policy in such a stroke, young\\nman.\"\\n\\nDuncan, who believed it of the last importance that they should speedily\\ncome at the contents of the letter borne by the scout, gladly encouraged\\nthis idea.\\n\\n\"Without doubt, he could gather no confidence by witnessing our\\nindifference,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You never said truer word. I could wish, sir, that he would visit the\\nworks in open day, and in the form of a storming party: that is the\\nleast failing method of proving the countenance of an enemy, and would\\nbe far preferable to the battering system he has chosen. The beauty and\\nmanliness of warfare has been much deformed, Major Heyward, by the arts\\nof your Monsieur Vauban. Our ancestors were far above such scientific\\ncowardice!\"\\n\\n\"It may be very true, sir; but we are now obliged to repel art by art.\\nWhat is your pleasure in the matter of the interview?\"\\n\\n\"I will meet the Frenchman, and that without fear or delay; promptly;\\nsir, as becomes a servant of my royal master. Go, Major Heyward, and\\ngive them a flourish of the music; and send out a messenger to let them\\nknow who is coming. We will follow with a small guard, for such respect\\nis due to one who holds the honor of his king in keeping; and harkee,\\nDuncan,\" he added, in a half whisper, though they were alone, \"it may be\\nprudent to have some aid at hand, in case there should be treachery at\\nthe bottom of it all.\"\\n\\nThe young man availed himself of this order to quit the apartment; and,\\nas the day was fast coming to a close, he hastened, without delay, to\\nmake the necessary arrangements. A very few minutes only were necessary\\nto parade a few files, and to despatch an orderly with a flag to\\nannounce the approach of the commandant of the fort. When Duncan had\\ndone both these, he led the guard to the sally-port, near which he found\\nhis superior ready, waiting his appearance. As soon as the usual\\nceremonials of a military departure were observed, the veteran and his\\nmore youthful companion left the fortress, attended by the escort.\\n\\nThey had proceeded only a hundred yards from the works, when the little\\narray which attended the French general to the conference, was seen\\nissuing from the hollow way, which formed the bed of a brook that ran\\nbetween the batteries of the besiegers and the fort. From the moment\\nthat Munro left his own works to appear in front of his enemies, his air\\nhad been grand, and his step and countenance highly military. The\\ninstant he caught a glimpse of the white plume that waved in the hat of\\nMontcalm, his eye lighted, and age no longer appeared to possess any\\ninfluence over his vast and still muscular person.\\n\\n\"Speak to the boys to be watchful, sir,\" he said, in an undertone, to\\nDuncan; \"and to look well to their flints and steel, for one is never\\nsafe with a servant of these Louises; at the same time, we will show\\nthem the front of men in deep security. Ye\\'ll understand me, Major\\nHeyward!\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by the clamor of a drum from the approaching\\nFrenchmen, which was immediately answered, when each party pushed an\\norderly in advance, bearing a white flag, and the wary Scotsman halted,\\nwith his guard close at his back. As soon as this slight salutation had\\npassed, Montcalm moved towards them with a quick but graceful step,\\nbaring his head to the veteran, and dropping his spotless plume nearly\\nto the earth in courtesy. If the air of Munro was more commanding and\\nmanly, it wanted both the ease and insinuating polish of that of the\\nFrenchman. Neither spoke for a few moments, each regarding the other\\nwith curious and interested eyes. Then, as became his superior rank and\\nthe nature of the interview, Montcalm broke the silence. After uttering\\nthe usual words of greeting, he turned to Duncan, and continued with a\\nsmile of recognition, speaking always in French,--\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nTHE MEETING OF THE GENERALS\\n\\n_As soon as this slight salutation had passed, Montcalm moved towards\\nthem with a quick but graceful step, baring his head to the veteran, and\\ndropping his spotless plume nearly to the earth in courtesy_]\\n\\n\"I am rejoiced, monsieur, that you have given us the pleasure of your\\ncompany on this occasion. There will be no necessity to employ an\\nordinary interpreter; for, in your hands, I feel the same security as if\\nI spoke your language myself.\"\\n\\nDuncan acknowledged the compliment, when Montcalm, turning to his guard,\\nwhich, in imitation of that of their enemies, pressed close upon him,\\ncontinued,--\\n\\n\"En arriere, mes enfans--il fait chaud; retirez-vous un peu.\"\\n\\nBefore Major Heyward would imitate this proof of confidence, he glanced\\nhis eyes around the plain, and beheld with uneasiness the numerous dusky\\ngroups of savages, who looked out from the margin of the surrounding\\nwoods, curious spectators of the interview.\\n\\n\"Monsieur de Montcalm will readily acknowledge the difference in our\\nsituation,\" he said, with some embarrassment, pointing at the same time\\ntowards those dangerous foes, who were to be seen in almost every\\ndirection. \"Were we to dismiss our guard, we should stand here at the\\nmercy of our enemies.\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur, you have the plighted faith of _un gentilhomme Francais_; for\\nyour safety,\" returned Montcalm, laying his hand impressively on his\\nheart; \"it should suffice.\"\\n\\n\"It shall. Fall back,\" Duncan added to the officer who led the escort;\\n\"fall back, sir, beyond hearing, and wait for orders.\"\\n\\nMunro witnessed this movement with manifest uneasiness; nor did he fail\\nto demand an instant explanation.\\n\\n\"Is it not our interest, sir, to betray no distrust?\" retorted Duncan.\\n\"Monsieur de Montcalm pledges his word for our safety, and I have\\nordered the men to withdraw a little, in order to prove how much we\\ndepend on his assurance.\"\\n\\n\"It may be all right, sir, but I have no overweening reliance on the\\nfaith of these marquesses, or marquis, as they call themselves. Their\\npatents of nobility are too common to be certain that they bear the seal\\nof true honor.\"\\n\\n\"You forget, dear sir, that we confer with an officer distinguished\\nalike in Europe and America for his deeds. From a soldier of his\\nreputation we can have nothing to apprehend.\"\\n\\nThe old man made a gesture of resignation, though his rigid features\\nstill betrayed his obstinate adherence to a distrust, which he derived\\nfrom a sort of hereditary contempt of his enemy, rather than from any\\npresent signs which might warrant so uncharitable a feeling. Montcalm\\nwaited patiently until this little dialogue in demi-voice was ended,\\nwhen he drew nigher, and opened the subject of their conference.\\n\\n\"I have solicited this interview from your superior, monsieur,\" he said,\\n\"because I believe he will allow himself to be persuaded that he has\\nalready done everything which is necessary for the honor of his prince,\\nand will not listen to the admonitions of humanity. I will forever bear\\ntestimony that his resistance has been gallant, and was continued as\\nlong as there was hope.\"\\n\\nWhen this opening was translated to Munro, he answered with dignity, but\\nwith sufficient courtesy,--\\n\\n\"However I may prize such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, it will be\\nmore valuable when it shall be better merited.\"\\n\\nThe French general smiled, as Duncan gave him the purport of this reply,\\nand observed,--\\n\\n\"What is now so freely accorded to approved courage, may be refused to\\nuseless obstinacy. Monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness, for\\nhimself, our numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them, with\\nsuccess?\"\\n\\n\"I know that the king of France is well served,\" returned the unmoved\\nScotsman, as soon as Duncan ended his translation; \"but my own royal\\nmaster has as many and as faithful troops.\"\\n\\n\"Though not at hand, fortunately for us,\" said Montcalm, without\\nwaiting, in his ardor, for the interpreter. \"There is a destiny in war,\\nto which a brave man knows how to submit, with the same courage that he\\nfaces his foes.\"\\n\\n\"Had I been conscious that Monsieur Montcalm was master of the English,\\nI should have spared myself the trouble of so awkward a translation,\"\\nsaid the vexed Duncan, dryly; remembering instantly his recent by-play\\nwith Munro.\\n\\n\"Your pardon, monsieur,\" rejoined the Frenchman, suffering a slight\\ncolor to appear on his dark cheek. \"There is a vast difference between\\nunderstanding and speaking a foreign tongue; you will, therefore, please\\nto assist me still.\" Then after a short pause, he added, \"These hills\\nafford us every opportunity of reconnoitring your works, messieurs, and\\nI am possibly as well acquainted with their weak condition as you can be\\nyourselves.\"\\n\\n\"Ask the French general if his glasses can reach to the Hudson,\" said\\nMunro, proudly; \"and if he knows when and where to expect the army of\\nWebb.\"\\n\\n\"Let General Webb be his own interpreter,\" returned the politic\\nMontcalm, suddenly extending an open letter towards Munro, as he spoke;\\n\"you will there learn, monsieur, that his movements are not likely to\\nprove embarrassing to my army.\"\\n\\nThe veteran seized the offered paper, without waiting for Duncan to\\ntranslate the speech, and with an eagerness that betrayed how important\\nhe deemed its contents. As his eye passed hastily over the words, his\\ncountenance changed from its look of military pride to one of deep\\nchagrin: his lip began to quiver; and, suffering the paper to fall from\\nhis hand, his head dropped upon his chest, like that of a man whose\\nhopes were withered at a single blow. Duncan caught the letter from the\\nground, and without apology for the liberty he took, he read at a glance\\nits cruel purport. Their common superior, so far from encouraging them\\nto resist, advised a speedy surrender, urging in the plainest language\\nas a reason, the utter impossibility of his sending a single man to\\ntheir rescue.\\n\\n\"Here is no deception!\" exclaimed Duncan, examining the billet both\\ninside and out; \"this is the signature of Webb, and must be the captured\\nletter.\"\\n\\n\"The man has betrayed me!\" Munro at length bitterly exclaimed: \"he has\\nbrought dishonor to the door of one where disgrace was never before\\nknown to dwell, and shame has he heaped heavily on my gray hairs.\"\\n\\n\"Say not so,\" cried Duncan; \"we are yet masters of the fort, and of our\\nhonor. Let us then sell our lives at such a rate as shall make our\\nenemies believe the purchase too dear.\"\\n\\n\"Boy, I thank thee,\" exclaimed the old man, rousing himself from his\\nstupor; \"you have, for once, reminded Munro of his duty. We will go\\nback, and dig our graves behind those ramparts.\"\\n\\n\"Messieurs,\" said Montcalm, advancing towards them a step, in generous\\ninterest, \"you little know Louis de St. Veran, if you believe him\\ncapable of profiting by this letter to humble brave men, or to build up\\na dishonest reputation for himself. Listen to my terms before you leave\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"What says the Frenchman?\" demanded the veteran, sternly; \"does he make\\na merit of having captured a scout, with a note from headquarters? Sir,\\nhe had better raise this siege, to go and sit down before Edward if he\\nwishes to frighten his enemy with words.\"\\n\\nDuncan explained the other\\'s meaning.\\n\\n\"Monsieur de Montcalm, we will hear you,\" the veteran added, more calmly,\\nas Duncan ended.\\n\\n\"To retain the fort is now impossible,\" said his liberal enemy; \"it is\\nnecessary to the interests of my master that it should be destroyed;\\nbut, as for yourselves, and your brave comrades, there is no privilege\\ndear to a soldier that shall be denied.\"\\n\\n\"Our colors?\" demanded Heyward.\\n\\n\"Carry them to England, and show them to your king.\"\\n\\n\"Our arms?\"\\n\\n\"Keep them; none can use them better.\"\\n\\n\"Our march; the surrender of the place?\"\\n\\n\"Shall all be done in a way most honorable to yourselves.\"\\n\\nDuncan now turned to explain these proposals to his commander, who heard\\nhim with amazement, and a sensibility that was deeply touched by such\\nunusual and unexpected generosity.\\n\\n\"Go you, Duncan,\" he said; \"go with this marquess, as indeed marquess he\\nshould be; go to his marquee and arrange it all. I have lived to see two\\nthings in my old age, that never did I expect to behold. An Englishman\\nafraid to support a friend, and a Frenchman too honest to profit by his\\nadvantage.\"\\n\\nSo saying, the veteran again dropped his head to his chest, and returned\\nslowly towards the fort, exhibiting, by the dejection of his air, to the\\nanxious garrison, a harbinger of evil tidings.\\n\\nFrom the shock of this unexpected blow the haughty feelings of Munro\\nnever recovered; but from that moment there commenced a change in his\\ndetermined character, which accompanied him to a speedy grave. Duncan\\nremained to settle the terms of the capitulation. He was seen to\\nre-enter the works during the first watches of the night, and\\nimmediately after a private conference with the commandant, to leave\\nthem again, It was then openly announced, that hostilities must\\ncease--Munro having signed a treaty, by which the place was to be\\nyielded to the enemy, with the morning; the garrison to retain their\\narms, their colors, and their baggage, and consequently, according to\\nmilitary opinion, their honor.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n  \"Weave we the woof. The thread is spun.\\n  The web is wove. The work is done.\"\\n\\n  GRAY.\\n\\n\\nThe hostile armies, which lay in the wilds of the Horican, passed the\\nnight of the 9th of August, 1757, much in the manner they would had they\\nencountered on the fairest fields of Europe. While the conquered were\\nstill, sullen, and dejected, the victors triumphed. But there are limits\\nalike to grief and joy; and long before the watches of the morning came,\\nthe stillness of those boundless woods was only broken by a gay call\\nfrom some exulting young Frenchman of the advanced pickets, or a\\nmenacing challenge from the fort, which sternly forbade the approach of\\nany hostile footsteps before the stipulated moment. Even these\\noccasional threatening sounds ceased to be heard in that dull hour which\\nprecedes the day, at which period a listener might have sought in vain\\nany evidence of the presence of those armed powers that then slumbered\\non the shores of the \"holy lake.\"\\n\\nIt was during these moments of deep silence, that the canvas which\\nconcealed the entrance to a spacious marquee in the French encampment\\nwas shoved aside, and a man issued from beneath the drapery into the\\nopen air. He was enveloped in a cloak that might have been intended as a\\nprotection from the chilling damps of the woods, but which served\\nequally well as a mantle, to conceal his person. He was permitted to\\npass the grenadier, who watched over the slumbers of the French\\ncommander, without interruption, the man making the usual salute which\\nbetokens military deference, as the other passed swiftly through the\\nlittle city of tents, in the direction of William Henry. Whenever this\\nunknown individual encountered one of the numberless sentinels who\\ncrossed his path, his answer was prompt, and as it appeared\\nsatisfactory; for he was uniformly allowed to proceed, without further\\ninterrogation.\\n\\nWith the exception of such repeated, but brief interruptions, he had\\nmoved, silently, from the centre of the camp, to its most advanced\\noutposts, when he drew nigh the soldier who held his watch nearest to\\nthe works of the enemy. As he approached he was received with the usual\\nchallenge,--\\n\\n\"Qui vive?\"\\n\\n\"France,\" was the reply.\\n\\n\"Le mot d\\'ordre?\"\\n\\n\"La victoire,\" said the other, drawing so nigh as to be heard in a loud\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\"C\\'est bien,\" returned the sentinel, throwing his musket from the charge\\nto his shoulder; \"vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!\"\\n\\n\"Il est necessaire d\\'etre vigilant, mon enfant,\" the other observed,\\ndropping a fold of his cloak, and looking the soldier close in the face,\\nas he passed him, still continuing his way towards the British\\nfortification. The man started; his arms rattled heavily, as he threw\\nthem forward, in the lowest and most respectful salute; and when he had\\nagain recovered his piece, he turned to walk his post, muttering between\\nhis teeth,--\\n\\n\"Il faut etre vigilant, en verite! je crois que nous avons la, un\\ncaporal qui ne dort jamais!\"\\n\\nThe officer proceeded, without affecting to hear the words which escaped\\nthe sentinel in his surprise; nor did he again pause until he had\\nreached the low strand, and in a somewhat dangerous vicinity to the\\nwestern water bastion of the fort. The light of an obscure moon was just\\nsufficient to render objects, though dim, perceptible in their outlines.\\nHe, therefore, took the precaution to place himself against the trunk of\\na tree, where he leaned for many minutes, and seemed to contemplate the\\ndark and silent mounds of the English works in profound attention. His\\ngaze at the ramparts was not that of a curious or idle spectator; but\\nhis looks wandered from point to point, denoting his knowledge of\\nmilitary usages, and betraying that his search was not unaccompanied by\\ndistrust. At length he appeared satisfied; and having cast his eyes\\nimpatiently upwards towards the summit of the eastern mountain, as if\\nanticipating the approach of the morning, he was in the act of turning\\non his footsteps, when a light sound on the nearest angle of the bastion\\ncaught his ear, and induced him to remain.\\n\\nJust then a figure was seen to approach the edge of the rampart, where\\nit stood, apparently contemplating in its turn the distant tents of the\\nFrench encampment. Its head was then turned towards the east, as though\\nequally anxious for the appearance of light, when the form leaned\\nagainst the mound, and seemed to gaze upon the glassy expanse of the\\nwaters, which, like a submarine firmament, glittered with its thousand\\nmimic stars. The melancholy air, the hour, together with the vast frame\\nof the man who thus leaned, in musing, against the English ramparts,\\nleft no doubt as to his person, in the mind of his observant spectator.\\nDelicacy, no less than prudence, now urged him to retire; and he had\\nmoved cautiously round the body of the tree for that purpose, when\\nanother sound drew his attention, and once more arrested his footsteps.\\nIt was a low and almost inaudible movement of the water, and was\\nsucceeded by a grating of pebbles one against the other. In a moment he\\nsaw a dark form rise, as it were out of the lake, and steal without\\nfurther noise to the land, within a few feet of the place where he\\nhimself stood. A rifle next slowly rose between his eyes and the watery\\nmirror; but before it could be discharged his own hand was on the lock.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" exclaimed the savage, whose treacherous aim was so singularly\\nand so unexpectedly interrupted.\\n\\nWithout making any reply, the French officer laid his hand on the\\nshoulder of the Indian, and led him in profound silence to a distance\\nfrom the spot, where their subsequent dialogue might have proved\\ndangerous, and where it seemed that one of them, at least, sought a\\nvictim. Then, throwing open his cloak, so as to expose his uniform and\\nthe cross of St. Louis which was suspended at his breast, Montcalm\\nsternly demanded,--\\n\\n\"What means this! Does not my son know that the hatchet is buried\\nbetween the English and his Canadian Father?\"\\n\\n\"What can the Hurons do?\" returned the savage, speaking also, though\\nimperfectly, in the French language. \"Not a warrior has a scalp, and the\\npale-faces make friends!\"\\n\\n\"Ha! Le Renard Subtil! Methinks this is an excess of zeal for a friend\\nwho was so late an enemy! How many suns have set since Le Renard struck\\nthe war-post of the English?\"\\n\\n\"Where is that sun!\" demanded the sullen savage. \"Behind the hill; and\\nit is dark and cold. But when he comes again, it will be bright and\\nwarm. Le Subtil is the sun of his tribe. There have been clouds, and\\nmany mountains between him and his nation; but now he shines, and it is\\na clear sky!\"\\n\\n\"That Le Renard has power with his people, I well know,\" said Montcalm;\\n\"for yesterday he hunted for their scalps, and to-day they hear him at\\nthe council-fire.\"\\n\\n\"Magua is a great chief.\"\\n\\n\"Let him prove it, by teaching his nation how to conduct itself towards\\nour new friends.\"\\n\\n\"Why did the chief of the Canadas bring his young men into the woods,\\nand fire his cannon at the earthen house?\" demanded the subtle Indian.\\n\\n\"To subdue it. My master owns the land, and your father has been ordered\\nto drive off these English squatters. They have consented to go, and now\\nhe calls them enemies no longer.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis well. Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. It is now\\nbright; when it is red, it shall be buried.\"\\n\\n\"But Magua is pledged not to sully the lilies of France. The enemies of\\nthe great king across the salt lake are his enemies; his friends, the\\nfriends of the Hurons.\"\\n\\n\"Friends!\" repeated the Indian, in scorn. \"Let his father give Magua a\\nhand.\"\\n\\nMontcalm, who felt that his influence over the warlike tribes he had\\ngathered was to be maintained by concession rather than by power,\\ncomplied reluctantly with the other\\'s request. The savage placed the\\nfinger of the French commander on a deep scar in his bosom, and then\\nexultingly demanded,--\\n\\n\"Does my father know that?\"\\n\\n\"What warrior does not? \\'tis where a leaden bullet has cut.\"\\n\\n\"And this?\" continued the Indian, who had turned his naked back to the\\nother, his body being without its usual calico mantle.\\n\\n\"This!--my son has been sadly injured, here; who has done this?\"\\n\\n\"Magua slept hard in the English wigwams, and the sticks have left their\\nmark,\" returned the savage, with a hollow laugh, which did not conceal\\nthe fierce temper that nearly choked him. Then recollecting himself,\\nwith sudden and native dignity, he added, \"Go; teach your young men, it\\nis peace. Le Renard Subtil knows how to speak to a Huron warrior.\"\\n\\nWithout deigning to bestow further words, or to wait for any answer, the\\nsavage cast his rifle into the hollow of his arm, and moved silently\\nthrough the encampment towards the woods where his own tribe was known\\nto lie. Every few yards as he proceeded he was challenged by the\\nsentinels; but he stalked sullenly onward, utterly disregarding the\\nsummons of the soldiers, who only spared his life because they knew the\\nair and tread no less than the obstinate daring of an Indian.\\n\\nMontcalm lingered long and melancholy on the strand, where he had been\\nleft by his companion, brooding deeply on the temper which his\\nungovernable ally had just discovered. Already had his fair fame been\\ntarnished by one horrid scene, and in circumstances fearfully resembling\\nthose under which he now found himself. As he mused he became keenly\\nsensible of the deep responsibility they assume who disregard the means\\nto attain their end, and of all the danger of setting in motion an\\nengine which it exceeds human power to control. Then shaking off a train\\nof reflections that he accounted a weakness in such a moment of triumph,\\nhe retraced his steps towards his tent, giving the order as he passed,\\nto make the signal that should arouse the army from its slumbers.\\n\\nThe first tap of the French drums was echoed from the bosom of the fort,\\nand presently the valley was filled with the strains of martial music,\\nrising long, thrilling, and lively above the rattling accompaniment. The\\nhorns of the victors sounded merry and cheerful flourishes, until the\\nlast laggard of the camp was at his post; but the instant the British\\nfifes had blown their shrill signal, they became mute. In the meantime\\nthe day had dawned, and when the line of the French army was ready to\\nreceive its general, the rays of a brilliant sun were glancing along the\\nglittering array. Then that success, which was already so well known,\\nwas officially announced; the favored band who were selected to guard\\nthe gates of the fort were detailed, and defiled before their chief; the\\nsignal of their approach was given, and all the usual preparations for a\\nchange of masters were ordered and executed directly under the guns of\\nthe contested works.\\n\\nA very different scene presented itself within the lines of the\\nAnglo-American army. As soon as the warning signal was given, it\\nexhibited all the signs of a hurried and forced departure. The sullen\\nsoldiers shouldered their empty tubes and fell into their places, like\\nmen whose blood had been heated by the past contest, and who only\\ndesired the opportunity to revenge an indignity which was still wounding\\nto their pride, concealed as it was under all the observances of\\nmilitary etiquette. Women and children ran from place to place, some\\nbearing the scanty remnants of their baggage, and others searching in\\nthe ranks for those countenances they looked up to for protection.\\n\\nMunro appeared among his silent troops firm but dejected. It was evident\\nthat the unexpected blow had struck deep into his heart, though he\\nstruggled to sustain his misfortune with the port of man.\\n\\nDuncan was touched at the quiet and impressive exhibition of his grief.\\nHe had discharged his own duty, and he now pressed to the side of the\\nold man, to know in what particular he might serve him.\\n\\n\"My daughters,\" was the brief but expressive reply.\\n\\n\"Good heavens! are not arrangements already made for their convenience?\"\\n\\n\"To-day I am only a soldier, Major Heyward,\" said the veteran. \"All that\\nyou see here, claim alike to be my children.\"\\n\\nDuncan had heard enough. Without losing one of those moments which had\\nnow become so precious, he flew towards the quarters of Munro, in quest\\nof the sisters. He found them on the threshold of the low edifice,\\nalready prepared to depart, and surrounded by a clamorous and weeping\\nassemblage of their own sex, that had gathered about the place, with a\\nsort of instinctive consciousness that it was the point most likely to\\nbe protected. Though the cheeks of Cora were pale, and her countenance\\nanxious, she had lost none of her firmness; but the eyes of Alice were\\ninflamed, and betrayed how long and bitterly she had wept. They both,\\nhowever, received the young man with undisguised pleasure; the former,\\nfor a novelty, being the first to speak.\\n\\n\"The fort is lost,\" she said, with a melancholy smile; \"though our good\\nname, I trust, remains.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis brighter than ever. But, dearest Miss Munro, it is time to think\\nless of others, and to make some provision for yourself. Military\\nusage,--pride,--that pride on which you so much value yourself, demands\\nthat your father and I should for a little while continue with the\\ntroops. Then where to seek a proper protector for you against the\\nconfusion and chances of such a scene?\"\\n\\n\"None is necessary,\" returned Cora; \"who will dare to injure or insult\\nthe daughter of such a father, at a time like this?\"\\n\\n\"I would not leave you alone,\" continued the youth, looking about him in\\na hurried manner, \"for the command of the best regiment in the pay of\\nthe king. Remember, our Alice is not gifted with all your firmness, and\\nGod only knows the terror she might endure.\"\\n\\n\"You may be right,\" Cora replied, smiling again, but far more sadly than\\nbefore. \"Listen! chance has already sent us a friend when he is most\\nneeded.\"\\n\\nDuncan did listen, and on the instant comprehended her meaning. The low\\nand serious sounds of the sacred music, so well known to the eastern\\nprovinces, caught his ear, and instantly drew him to an apartment in an\\nadjacent building, which had already been deserted by its customary\\ntenants. There he found David, pouring out his pious feelings, through\\nthe only medium in which he ever indulged. Duncan waited, until, by the\\ncessation of the movement of the hand, he believed the strain was ended,\\nwhen, by touching his shoulder, he drew the attention of the other to\\nhimself, and in a few words explained his wishes.\\n\\n\"Even so,\" replied the single-minded disciple of the King of Israel,\\nwhen the young man had ended; \"I have found much that is comely and\\nmelodious in the maidens, and it is fitting that we who have consorted\\nin so much peril, should abide together in peace. I will attend them,\\nwhen I have completed my morning praise, to which nothing is now wanting\\nbut the doxology. Wilt thou bear a part, friend? The metre is common,\\nand the tune, \\'Southwell.\\'\"\\n\\nThen, extending the little volume, and giving the pitch of the air anew\\nwith considerate attention, David recommenced and finished his strains,\\nwith a fixedness of manner that it was not easy to interrupt. Heyward\\nwas fain to wait until the verse was ended; when, seeing David relieving\\nhimself from the spectacles, and replacing the book, he continued,--\\n\\n\"It will be your duty to see that none dare to approach the ladies with\\nany rude intention, or to offer insult or taunt at the misfortune of\\ntheir brave father. In this task you will be seconded by the domestics\\nof their household.\"\\n\\n\"Even so.\"\\n\\n\"It is possible that the Indians and stragglers of the enemy may\\nintrude, in which case you will remind them of the terms of the\\ncapitulation, and threaten to report their conduct to Montcalm. A word\\nwill suffice.\"\\n\\n\"If not, I have that here which shall,\" returned David, exhibiting his\\nbook, with an air in which meekness and confidence were singularly\\nblended. \"Here are words which, uttered, or rather thundered, with\\nproper emphasis, and in measured time, shall quiet the most unruly\\ntemper:--\\n\\n  \"\\'Why rage the heathen furiously!\\'\"--\\n\\n\"Enough,\" said Heyward, interrupting the burst of his musical\\ninvocation: \"we understand each other; it is time that we should now\\nassume our respective duties.\"\\n\\nGamut cheerfully assented, and together they sought the females. Cora\\nreceived her new, and somewhat extraordinary protector, courteously at\\nleast; and even the pallid features of Alice lighted again with some of\\ntheir native archness as she thanked Heyward for his care. Duncan took\\noccasion to assure them he had done the best that circumstances\\npermitted, and, as he believed, quite enough for the security of their\\nfeelings; of danger there was none. He then spoke gladly of his\\nintention to rejoin them the moment he had led the advance a few miles\\ntowards the Hudson, and immediately took his leave.\\n\\nBy this time the signal of departure had been given, and the head of the\\nEnglish column was in motion. The sisters started at the sound, and\\nglancing their eyes around, they saw the white uniforms of the French\\ngrenadiers, who had already taken possession of the gates of the fort.\\nAt that moment, an enormous cloud seemed to pass suddenly above their\\nheads, and looking upward, they discovered that they stood beneath the\\nwide folds of the standard of France.\\n\\n\"Let us go,\" said Cora; \"this is no longer a fit place for the children\\nof an English officer.\"\\n\\nAlice clung to the arm of her sister, and together they left the parade,\\naccompanied by the moving throng that surrounded them.\\n\\nAs they passed the gates, the French officers, who had learned their\\nrank, bowed often and low, forbearing, however, to intrude those\\nattentions which they saw, with peculiar tact, might not be agreeable.\\nAs every vehicle and each beast of burden was occupied by the sick and\\nwounded, Cora had decided to endure the fatigues of a foot march, rather\\nthan interfere with their comforts. Indeed, many a maimed and feeble\\nsoldier was compelled to drag his exhausted limbs in the rear of the\\ncolumns, for the want of the necessary means of conveyance, in that\\nwilderness. The whole, however, was in motion; the weak and wounded,\\ngroaning, and in suffering; their comrades, silent and sullen; and the\\nwomen and children in terror, they knew not of what.\\n\\nAs the confused and timid throng left the protecting mounds of the fort,\\nand issued on the open plain, the whole scene was at once presented to\\ntheir eyes. At a little distance on the right, and somewhat in the rear,\\nthe French army stood to their arms, Montcalm having collected his\\nparties, so soon as his guards had possession of the works. They were\\nattentive but silent observers of the proceedings of the vanquished,\\nfailing in none of the stipulated military honors, and offering no taunt\\nor insult, in their success, to their less fortunate foes. Living masses\\nof the English, to the amount in the whole of near three thousand, were\\nmoving slowly across the plain, towards the common centre, and gradually\\napproached each other, as they converged to the point of their march, a\\nvista cut through the lofty trees, where the road to the Hudson entered\\nthe forest. Along the sweeping borders of the woods, hung a dark cloud\\nof savages, eying the passage of their enemies, and hovering, at a\\ndistance, like vultures, who were only kept from swooping on their prey,\\nby the presence and restraint of a superior army. A few had straggled\\namong the conquered columns, where they stalked in sullen discontent;\\nattentive, though, as yet, passive observers of the moving multitude.\\n\\nThe advance, with Heyward at its head, had already reached the defile,\\nand was slowly disappearing, when the attention of Cora was drawn to a\\ncollection of stragglers, by the sounds of contention. A truant\\nprovincial was paying the forfeit of his disobedience, by being\\nplundered of those very effects which had caused him to desert his place\\nin the ranks. The man was of powerful frame, and too avaricious to part\\nwith his goods without a struggle. Individuals from either party\\ninterfered; the one side to prevent, and the other to aid in the\\nrobbery. Voices grew loud and angry, and a hundred savages appeared, as\\nit were by magic, where a dozen only had been seen a minute before. It\\nwas then that Cora saw the form of Magua gliding among his countrymen,\\nand speaking with his fatal and artful eloquence. The mass of women and\\nchildren stopped, and hovered together like alarmed and fluttering\\nbirds. But the cupidity of the Indian was soon gratified, and the\\ndifferent bodies again moved slowly onward.\\n\\nThe savages now fell back, and seemed content to let their enemies\\nadvance without further molestation. But as the female crowd approached\\nthem, the gaudy colors of a shawl attracted the eyes of a wild and\\nuntutored Huron. He advanced to seize it, without the least hesitation.\\nThe woman, more in terror than through love of the ornament, wrapped her\\nchild in the coveted article, and folded both more closely to her bosom.\\nCora was in the act of speaking, with an intent to advise the woman to\\nabandon the trifle, when the savage relinquished his hold of the shawl,\\nand tore the screaming infant from her arms. Abandoning everything to\\nthe greedy grasp of those around her, the mother darted, with\\ndistraction in her mien, to reclaim her child. The Indian smiled grimly,\\nand extended one hand, in sign of a willingness to exchange, while with\\nthe other, he flourished the babe over his head, holding it by the feet\\nas if to enhance the value of the ransom.\\n\\n\"Here--here--there--all--any--everything!\" exclaimed the breathless\\nwoman; tearing the lighter articles of dress from her person, with\\nill-directed and trembling fingers; \"take all, but give me my babe!\"\\n\\nThe savage spurned the worthless rags, and perceiving that the shawl had\\nalready become a prize to another, his bantering but sullen smile\\nchanging to a gleam of ferocity, he dashed the head of the infant\\nagainst a rock, and cast its quivering remains to her very feet. For an\\ninstant, the mother stood, like a statue of despair, looking wildly down\\nat the unseemly object, which had so lately nestled in her bosom and\\nsmiled in her face; and then she raised her eyes and countenance towards\\nheaven, as if calling on God to curse the perpetrator of the foul deed.\\nShe was spared the sin of such a prayer; for, maddened at his\\ndisappointment, and excited at the sight of blood, the Huron mercifully\\ndrove his tomahawk into her own brain. The mother sank under the blow,\\nand fell, grasping at her child, in death, with the same engrossing love\\nthat had caused her to cherish it when living.\\n\\nAt that dangerous moment Magua placed his hands to his mouth, and raised\\nthe fatal and appalling whoop. The scattered Indians started at the\\nwell-known cry, as coursers bound at the signal to quit the goal; and,\\ndirectly, there arose such a yell along the plain, and through the\\narches of the wood, as seldom burst from human lips before. They who\\nheard it listened with a curdling horror at the heart, little inferior\\nto that dread which may be expected to attend the blasts of the final\\nsummons.\\n\\nMore than two thousand raving savages broke from the forest at the\\nsignal, and threw themselves across the fatal plain with instinctive\\nalacrity. We shall not dwell on the revolting horrors that succeeded.\\nDeath was everywhere, and in his most terrific and disgusting aspects.\\nResistance only served to inflame the murderers, who inflicted their\\nfurious blows long after their victims were beyond the power of their\\nresentment. The flow of blood might be likened to the outbreaking of a\\ntorrent; and, as the natives became heated and maddened by the sight,\\nmany among them even kneeled to the earth, and drank freely, exultingly,\\nhellishly, of the crimson tide.\\n\\nThe trained bodies of the troops threw themselves quickly into solid\\nmasses, endeavoring to awe their assailants by the imposing appearance\\nof a military front. The experiment in some measure succeeded, though\\nfar too many suffered their unloaded muskets to be torn from their\\nhands, in the vain hope of appeasing the savages.\\n\\nIn such a scene none had leisure to note the fleeting moments. It might\\nhave been ten minutes (it seemed an age), that the sisters had stood\\nriveted to one spot, horror-stricken, and nearly helpless. When the\\nfirst blow was struck, their screaming companions had pressed upon them\\nin a body, rendering flight impossible; and now that fear or death had\\nscattered most, if not all, from around them, they saw no avenue open,\\nbut such as conducted to the tomahawks of their foes. On every side\\narose shrieks, groans, exhortations, and curses. At this moment Alice\\ncaught a glimpse of the vast form of her father, moving rapidly across\\nthe plain, in the direction of the French army. He was, in truth,\\nproceeding to Montcalm, fearless of every danger, to claim the tardy\\nescort for which he had before conditioned. Fifty glittering axes and\\nbarbed spears were offered unheeded at his life, but the savages\\nrespected his rank and calmness, even in their fury. The dangerous\\nweapons were brushed aside by the still nervous arm of the veteran, or\\nfell of themselves, after menacing an act that it would seem no one had\\ncourage to perform. Fortunately, the vindictive Magua was searching for\\nhis victim in the very band the veteran had just quitted.\\n\\n\"Father--father--we are here!\" shrieked Alice, as he passed, at no great\\ndistance, without appearing to heed them. \"Come to us, father, or we\\ndie!\"\\n\\nThe cry was repeated, and in terms and tones that might have melted a\\nheart of stone, but it was unanswered. Once, indeed, the old man\\nappeared to catch the sounds, for he paused and listened; but Alice had\\ndropped senseless on the earth, and Cora had sunk at her side, hovering\\nin untiring tenderness over her lifeless form. Munro shook his head in\\ndisappointment, and proceeded, bent on the high duty of his station.\\n\\n\"Lady,\" said Gamut, who, helpless and useless as he was, had not yet\\ndreamed of deserting his trust, \"it is the jubilee of the devils, and\\nthis is not a meet place for Christians to tarry in. Let us up and fly.\"\\n\\n\"Go,\" said Cora, still gazing at her unconscious sister; \"save thyself.\\nTo me thou canst not be of further use.\"\\n\\nDavid comprehended the unyielding character of her resolution, by the\\nsimple but expressive gesture that accompanied her words. He gazed, for\\na moment, at the dusky forms that were acting their hellish rites on\\nevery side of him, and his tall person grew more erect, while his chest\\nheaved, and every feature swelled, and seemed to speak with the power of\\nthe feelings by which he was governed.\\n\\n\"If the Jewish boy might tame the evil spirit of Saul by the sound of\\nhis harp, and the words of sacred song, it may not be amiss,\" he said,\\n\"to try the potency of music here.\"\\n\\nThen raising his voice to its highest tones, he poured out a strain so\\npowerful as to be heard even amid the din of that bloody field. More\\nthan one savage rushed towards them, thinking to rifle the unprotected\\nsisters of their attire, and bear away their scalps; but when they found\\nthis strange and unmoved figure riveted to his post, they paused to\\nlisten. Astonishment soon changed to admiration, and they passed on to\\nother and less courageous victims, openly expressing their satisfaction\\nat the firmness with which the white warrior sang his death song.\\nEncouraged and deluded by his success, David exerted all his powers to\\nextend what he believed so holy an influence. The unwonted sounds caught\\nthe ears of a distant savage, who flew raging from group to group, like\\none who, scorning to touch the vulgar herd, hunted for some victim more\\nworthy of his renown. It was Magua, who uttered a yell of pleasure when\\nhe beheld his ancient prisoners again at his mercy.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said, laying his soiled hands on the dress of Cora, \"the\\nwigwam of the Huron is still open. Is it not better than this place?\"\\n\\n\"Away!\" cried Cora, veiling her eyes from his revolting aspect.\\n\\nThe Indian laughed tauntingly, as he held up his reeking hand, and\\nanswered,--\"It is red, but it comes from white veins!\"\\n\\n\"Monster! there is blood, oceans of blood, upon thy soul; thy spirit has\\nmoved this scene.\"\\n\\n\"Magua is a great chief!\" returned the exulting savage; \"will the dark\\nhair go to his tribe?\"\\n\\n\"Never! strike, if thou wilt, and complete thy revenge.\"\\n\\nHe hesitated a moment; and then catching the light and senseless form of\\nAlice in his arms, the subtle Indian moved swiftly across the plain\\ntowards the woods.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" shrieked Cora, following wildly on his footsteps; \"release the\\nchild! wretch! what is\\'t you do?\"\\n\\nBut Magua was deaf to her voice; or rather he knew his power, and was\\ndetermined to maintain it.\\n\\n\"Stay--lady--stay,\" called Gamut, after the unconscious Cora. \"The holy\\ncharm is beginning to be felt, and soon shalt thou see this horrid\\ntumult stilled.\"\\n\\nPerceiving that, in his turn, he was unheeded, the faithful David\\nfollowed the distracted sister, raising his voice again in sacred song,\\nand sweeping the air to the measure, with his long arm, in diligent\\naccompaniment. In this manner they traversed the plain, through the\\nflying, the wounded, and the dead. The fierce Huron was, at any time,\\nsufficient for himself and the victim that he bore; though Cora would\\nhave fallen, more than once, under the blows of her savage enemies, but\\nfor the extraordinary being who stalked in her rear, and who now\\nappeared to the astonished natives gifted with the protecting spirit of\\nmadness.\\n\\nMagua, who knew how to avoid the more pressing dangers, and also to\\nelude pursuit, entered the woods through a low ravine, where he quickly\\nfound the Narragansetts, which the travellers had abandoned so shortly\\nbefore, awaiting his appearance, in custody of a savage as fierce and as\\nmalign in his expression as himself. Laying Alice on one of the horses,\\nhe made a sign to Cora to mount the other.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the horror excited by the presence of her captor, there\\nwas a present relief in escaping from the bloody scene enacting on the\\nplain, to which Cora could not be altogether insensible. She took her\\nseat, and held forth her arms for her sister, with an air of entreaty\\nand love that even the Huron could not deny. Placing Alice, then, on the\\nsame animal with Cora, he seized the bridle, and commenced his route by\\nplunging deeper into the forest. David, perceiving that he was left\\nalone, utterly disregarded, as a subject too worthless even to destroy,\\nthrew his long limb across the saddle of the beast they had deserted,\\nand made such progress in the pursuit as the difficulties of the path\\npermitted.\\n\\nThey soon began to ascend, but as the motion had a tendency to revive\\nthe dormant faculties of her sister, the attention of Cora was too much\\ndivided between the tenderest solicitude in her behalf, and in listening\\nto the cries which were still too audible on the plain, to note the\\ndirection in which they journeyed. When, however, they gained the\\nflattened surface of the mountain-top, and approached the eastern\\nprecipice, she recognized the spot to which she had once before been led\\nunder the more friendly auspices of the scout. Here Magua suffered them\\nto dismount; and, notwithstanding their own captivity, the curiosity\\nwhich seems inseparable from horror, induced them to gaze at the\\nsickening sight below.\\n\\nThe cruel work was still unchecked. On every side the captured were\\nflying before their relentless persecutors, while the armed columns of\\nthe Christian king stood fast in an apathy which has never been\\nexplained, and which has left an unmovable blot on the otherwise fair\\nescutcheon of their leader. Nor was the sword of death stayed until\\ncupidity got the mastery of revenge. Then, indeed, the shrieks of the\\nwounded and the yells of their murderers grew less frequent, until,\\nfinally, the cries of horror were lost to their ear, or were drowned in\\nthe loud, long, and piercing whoops of the triumphant savages.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n '\\n  _\"Bot._--Are we all met?\"\\n\\n  _\"Qui._--Pat--pat; and here\\'s a marvellous\\n  Convenient place for our rehearsal.\"\\n\\n  _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream._\\n\\n\\nThe reader may better imagine, than we describe, the surprise of\\nHeyward. His lurking Indians were suddenly converted into four-footed\\nbeasts; his lake into a beaver pond; his cataract into a dam,\\nconstructed by those industrious and ingenious quadrupeds; and a\\nsuspected enemy into his tried friend, David Gamut, the master of\\npsalmody. The presence of the latter created so many unexpected hopes\\nrelative to the sisters that, without a moment\\'s hesitation, the young\\nman broke out of his ambush, and sprang forward to join the two\\nprincipal actors in the scene.\\n\\nThe merriment of Hawkeye was not easily appeased. Without ceremony, and\\nwith a rough hand, he twirled the supple Gamut around on his heel, and\\nmore than once affirmed that the Hurons had done themselves great credit\\nin the fashion of his costume. Then seizing the hand of the other, he\\nsqueezed it with a gripe that brought the tears into the eyes of the\\nplacid David, and wished him joy of his new condition.\\n\\n\"You were about opening your throat-practysings among the beavers, were\\nye?\" he said. \"The cunning devils know half the trade already, for they\\nbeat the time with their tails, as you heard just now; and in good time\\nit was too, or \\'Killdeer\\' might have sounded the first note among them.\\nI have known greater fools, who could read and write, than an\\nexperienced old beaver; but as for squalling, the animals are born dumb!\\nWhat think you of such a song as this?\"\\n\\nDavid shut his sensitive ears, and even Heyward, apprised as he was of\\nthe nature of the cry, looked upwards in quest of the bird, as the\\ncawing of a crow rang in the air about them.\\n\\n\"See!\" continued the laughing scout, as he pointed towards the remainder\\nof the party, who, in obedience to the signal, were already\\napproaching: \"this is music which has its natural virtues; it brings two\\ngood rifles to my elbow, to say nothing of the knives and tomahawks. But\\nwe see that you are safe; now tell us what has become of the maidens.\"\\n\\n\"They are captives to the heathen,\" said David; \"and though greatly\\ntroubled in spirit, enjoying comfort and safety in the body.\"\\n\\n\"Both?\" demanded the breathless Heyward.\\n\\n\"Even so. Though our wayfaring has been sore and our sustenance scanty,\\nwe have had little other cause for complaint, except the violence done\\nour feelings, by being thus led in captivity into a far land.\"\\n\\n\"Bless ye for these very words!\" exclaimed the trembling Munro; \"I shall\\nthen receive my babes spotless and angel-like, as I lost them!\"\\n\\n\"I know not that their delivery is at hand,\" returned the doubting\\nDavid; \"the leader of these savages is possessed of an evil spirit that\\nno power short of Omnipotence can tame. I have tried him sleeping and\\nwaking, but neither sounds nor language seem to touch his soul.\"\\n\\n\"Where is the knave?\" bluntly interrupted the scout.\\n\\n\"He hunts the moose to-day, with his young men; and to-morrow, as I\\nhear, they pass farther into these forests, and nigher to the borders of\\nCanada. The elder maiden is conveyed to a neighboring people, whose\\nlodges are situate beyond yonder black pinnacle of rock; while the\\nyounger is detained among the women of the Hurons, whose dwellings are\\nbut two short miles hence, on a table-land, where the fire has done the\\noffice of the axe, and prepared the place for their reception.\"\\n\\n\"Alice, my gentle Alice!\" murmured Heyward; \"she has lost the\\nconsolation of her sister\\'s presence!\"\\n\\n\"Even so. But so far as praise and thanksgiving in psalmody can temper\\nthe spirit in affliction, she has not suffered.\"\\n\\n\"Has she then a heart for music?\"\\n\\n\"Of the graver and more solemn character; though it must be acknowledged\\nthat, in spite of all my endeavors, the maiden weeps oftener than she\\nsmiles. At such moments I forbear to press the holy songs; but there are\\nmany sweet and comfortable periods of satisfactory communication, when\\nthe ears of the savages are astounded with the upliftings of our\\nvoices.\"\\n\\n\"And why are you permitted to go at large, unwatched?\"\\n\\nDavid composed his features into what he intended should express an air\\nof modest humility, before he meekly replied--\\n\\n\"Little be the praise to such a worm as I. But, though the power of\\npsalmody was suspended in the terrible business of that field of blood\\nthrough which we passed, it has recovered its influence even over the\\nsouls of the heathen, and I am suffered to go and come at will.\"\\n\\nThe scout laughed, and tapping his own forehead significantly, he\\nperhaps explained the singular indulgence more satisfactorily when he\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"The Indians never harm a non-composser. But why, when the path lay open\\nbefore your eyes, did you not strike back on your own trail (it is not\\nso blind as that which a squirrel would make), and bring in the tidings\\nto Edward?\"\\n\\nThe scout, remembering only his own sturdy and iron nature, had probably\\nexacted a task that David, under no circumstances, could have performed.\\nBut, without entirely losing the meekness of his air, the latter was\\ncontent to answer--\\n\\n\"Though my soul would rejoice to visit the habitations of Christendom\\nonce more, my feet would rather follow the tender spirits intrusted to\\nmy keeping, even into the idolatrous province of the Jesuits, than take\\none step backward, while they pined in captivity and sorrow.\"\\n\\nThough the figurative language of David was not very intelligible, the\\nsincere and steady expression of his eye, and the glow on his honest\\ncountenance, were not easily mistaken. Uncas pressed closer to his side,\\nand regarded the speaker with a look of commendation, while his father\\nexpressed his satisfaction by the ordinary pithy exclamation of\\napprobation. The scout shook his head as he rejoined--\\n\\n\"The Lord never intended that the man should place all his endeavors in\\nhis throat, to the neglect of other and better gifts! But he has fallen\\ninto the hands of some silly woman, when he should have been gathering\\nhis education under a blue sky, among the beauties of the forest. Here,\\nfriend; I did intend to kindle a fire with this tooting whistle of\\nthine; but as you value the thing, take it, and blow your best on it!\"\\n\\nGamut received his pitch-pipe with as strong an expression of pleasure\\nas he believed compatible with the grave functions he exercised. After\\nessaying its virtues repeatedly, in contrast with his own voice, and\\nsatisfying himself that none of its melody was lost, he made a very\\nserious demonstration towards achieving a few stanzas of one of the\\nlongest effusions in the little volume so often mentioned.\\n\\nHeyward, however, hastily interrupted his pious purpose, by continuing\\nquestions concerning the past and present condition of his\\nfellow-captives, and in a manner more methodical than had been permitted\\nby his feelings in the opening of their interview. David, though he\\nregarded his treasure with longing eyes, was constrained to answer:\\nespecially as the venerable father took a part in the interrogatories,\\nwith an interest too imposing to be denied. Nor did the scout fail to\\nthrow in a pertinent inquiry, whenever a fitting occasion presented. In\\nthis manner, though with frequent interruptions, which were filled with\\ncertain threatening sounds from the recovered instrument, the pursuers\\nwere put in possession of such leading circumstances as were likely to\\nprove useful in accomplishing their great and engrossing object--the\\nrecovery of the sisters. The narrative of David was simple, and the\\nfacts but few.\\n\\nMagua had waited on the mountain until a safe moment to retire presented\\nitself, when he had descended, and taken the route along the western\\nside of the Horican, in the direction of the Canadas. As the subtle\\nHuron was familiar with the paths, and well knew there was no immediate\\ndanger of pursuit, their progress had been moderate, and far from\\nfatiguing. It appeared from the unembellished statement of David, that\\nhis own presence had been rather endured than desired; though even Magua\\nhad not been entirely exempt from that veneration with which the Indians\\nregard those whom the Great Spirit has visited in their intellects. At\\nnight, the utmost care had been taken of the captives, both to prevent\\ninjury from the damps of the woods, and to guard against an escape. At\\nthe spring, the horses were turned loose, as has been seen; and\\nnotwithstanding the remoteness and length of their trail, the artifices\\nalready named were resorted to, in order to cut off every clue to their\\nplace of retreat. On their arrival at the encampment of his people,\\nMagua, in obedience to a policy seldom departed from, separated his\\nprisoners. Cora had been sent to a tribe that temporarily occupied an\\nadjacent valley, though David was too ignorant of the customs and\\nhistory of the natives to be able to declare anything satisfactory\\nconcerning their name or character. He only knew that they had not\\nengaged in the late expedition against William Henry; that, like the\\nHurons themselves, they were allies of Montcalm; and that they\\nmaintained an amicable, though a watchful intercourse with the warlike\\nand savage people, whom chance had, for a time, brought in such close\\nand disagreeable contact with themselves.\\n\\nThe Mohicans and the scout listened to his interrupted and imperfect\\nnarrative, with an interest that obviously increased as he proceeded;\\nand it was while attempting to explain the pursuits of the community in\\nwhich Cora was detained, that the latter abruptly demanded--\\n\\n\"Did you see the fashion of their knives? Were they of English or French\\nformation?\"\\n\\n\"My thoughts were bent on no such vanities, but rather mingled in\\nconsolation with those of the maidens.\"\\n\\n\"The time may come when you will not consider the knife of a savage such\\na despisable vanity,\" returned the scout, with a strong expression of\\ncontempt for the other\\'s dulness. \"Had they held their corn-feast--or\\ncan you say anything of the totems of the tribe?\"\\n\\n\"Of corn, we had many and plentiful feasts; for the grain, being in the\\nmilk, is both sweet to the mouth and comfortable to the stomach. Of\\ntotem, I know not the meaning; but if it appertaineth in any wise to the\\nart of Indian music, it need not be inquired after at their hands. They\\nnever join their voices in praise, and it would seem that they are among\\nthe profanest of the idolatrous.\"\\n\\n\"Therein you belie the nature of an Indian. Even the Mingo adores but\\nthe true and living God. \\'Tis a wicked fabrication of the whites, and I\\nsay it to the shame of my color, that would make the warrior bow down\\nbefore images of his own creation. It is true, they endeavor to make\\ntruces with the wicked one--as who would not with an enemy he cannot\\nconquer!--but they look up for favor and assistance to the Great and\\nGood Spirit only.\"\\n\\n\"It may be so,\" said David; \"but I have seen strange and fantastic\\nimages drawn in their paint, of which their admiration and care savored\\nof spiritual pride; especially one, and that, too, a foul and loathsome\\nobject.\"\\n\\n\"Was it a sarpent?\" quickly demanded the scout.\\n\\n\"Much the same. It was in the likeness of an abject and creeping\\ntortoise.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" exclaimed both the attentive Mohicans in a breath; while the\\nscout shook his head with an air of one who had made an important, but\\nby no means a pleasing discovery. Then the father spoke, in the language\\nof the Delawares, and with a calmness and dignity that instantly\\narrested the attention even of those to whom his words were\\nunintelligible. His gestures were impressive, and at times energetic.\\nOnce he lifted his arm on high; and as it descended, the action threw\\naside the folds of his light mantle, a finger resting on his breast, as\\nif he would enforce his meaning by the attitude. Duncan\\'s eyes followed\\nthe movement, and he perceived that the animal just mentioned was\\nbeautifully, though faintly, worked in a blue tint, on the swarthy\\nbreast of the chief. All that he had ever heard of the violent\\nseparation of the vast tribes of the Delawares rushed across his mind,\\nand he awaited the proper moment to speak, with a suspense that was\\nrendered nearly intolerable, by his interest in the stake. His wish,\\nhowever, was anticipated by the scout, who turned from his red friend,\\nsaying--\\n\\n\"We have found that which may be good or evil to us, as Heaven disposes.\\nThe Sagamore is of the high blood of the Delawares, and is the great\\nchief of their Tortoises! That some of this stock are among the people\\nof whom the singer tells us, is plain, by his words; and had he but\\nspent half the breath in prudent questions, that he has blown away in\\nmaking a trumpet of his throat, we might have known how many warriors\\nthey numbered. It is, altogether, a dangerous path we move in; for a\\nfriend whose face is turned from you often bears a bloodier mind than\\nthe enemy who seeks your scalp.\"\\n\\n\"Explain,\" said Duncan.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a long and melancholy tradition, and one I little like to think\\nof; for it is not to be denied, that the evil has been mainly done by\\nmen with white skins. But it has ended in turning the tomahawk of\\nbrother against brother, and brought the Mingo and the Delaware to\\ntravel in the same path.\"\\n\\n\"You then suspect it is a portion of that people among whom Cora\\nresides?\"\\n\\nThe scout nodded his head in assent, though he seemed anxious to waive\\nthe further discussion of a subject that appeared painful. The impatient\\nDuncan now made several hasty and desperate propositions to attempt the\\nrelease of the sisters. Munro seemed to shake off his apathy, and\\nlistened to the wild schemes of the young man with a deference that his\\ngray hairs and reverend years should have denied. But the scout, after\\nsuffering the ardor of the lover to expend itself a little, found means\\nto convince him of the folly of precipitation, in a matter that would\\nrequire their coolest judgment and utmost fortitude.\\n\\n\"It would be well,\" he added, \"to let this man go in again, as usual,\\nand for him to tarry in the lodges, giving notice to the gentle ones of\\nour approach, until we call him out, by signal, to consult. You know the\\ncry of a crow, friend, from the whistle of the whippoorwill?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a pleasing bird,\" returned David, \"and has a soft and melancholy\\nnote! though the time is rather quick and ill-measured.\"\\n\\n\"He speaks of the wish-ton-wish,\" said the scout; \"well, since you like\\nhis whistle, it shall be your signal. Remember, then, when you hear the\\nwhippoorwill\\'s call three times repeated, you are to come into the\\nbushes where the bird might be supposed----\"\\n\\n\"Stop,\" interrupted Heyward; \"I will accompany him.\"\\n\\n\"You!\" exclaimed the astonished Hawkeye; \"are you tired of seeing the\\nsun rise and set?\"\\n\\n\"David is a living proof that the Hurons can be merciful.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, but David can use his throat, as no man in his senses would pervert\\nthe gift.\"\\n\\n\"I, too, can play the madman, the fool, the hero; in short, any or\\neverything to rescue her I love. Name your objections no longer; I am\\nresolved.\"\\n\\nHawkeye regarded the young man a moment in speechless amazement. But\\nDuncan, who, in deference to the other\\'s skill and services, had\\nhitherto submitted somewhat implicitly to his dictation, now assumed the\\nsuperior, with a manner that was not easily resisted. He waved his hand,\\nin sign of his dislike to all remonstrance, and then, in more tempered\\nlanguage, he continued--\\n\\n\"You have the means of disguise; change me; paint me, too, if you will;\\nin short, alter me to anything--a fool.\"\\n\\n\"It is not for one like me to say that he who is already formed by so\\npowerful a hand as Providence, stands in need of a change,\" muttered the\\ndiscontented scout. \"When you send your parties abroad in war, you find\\nit prudent, at least, to arrange the marks and places of encampment, in\\norder that they who fight on your side may know when and where to expect\\na friend.\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" interrupted Duncan; \"you have heard from this faithful\\nfollower of the captives, that the Indians are of two tribes, if not of\\ndifferent nations. With one, whom you think to be a branch of the\\nDelawares, is she you call the \\'dark-hair\\'; the other, and younger of\\nthe ladies, is undeniably with our declared enemies, the Hurons. It\\nbecomes my youth and rank to attempt the latter adventure. While you,\\ntherefore, are negotiating with your friends for the release of one of\\nthe sisters, I will effect that of the other, or die.\"\\n\\nThe awakened spirit of the young soldier gleamed in his eyes, and his\\nform became imposing under its influence. Hawkeye, though too much\\naccustomed to Indian artifices not to foresee the danger of the\\nexperiment, knew not well how to combat this sudden resolution.\\n\\nPerhaps there was something in the proposal that suited his own hardy\\nnature, and that secret love of desperate adventure, which had increased\\nwith his experience, until hazard and danger had become, in some\\nmeasure, necessary to the enjoyment of his existence. Instead of\\ncontinuing to oppose the scheme of Duncan, his humor suddenly altered,\\nand he lent himself to its execution.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said, with a good-humored smile; \"the buck that will take to\\nthe water must be headed, and not followed. Chingachgook has as many\\ndifferent paints as the engineer officer\\'s wife, who takes down natur\\'\\non scraps of paper, making the mountains look like cocks of rusty hay,\\nand placing the blue sky in reach of your hand. The Sagamore can use\\nthem, too. Seat yourself on the log; and my life on it, he can soon make\\na natural fool of you, and that well to your liking.\"\\n\\nDuncan complied; and the Mohican, who had been an attentive listener to\\nthe discourse, readily undertook the office. Long practised in all the\\nsubtle arts of his race, he drew, with great dexterity and quickness,\\nthe fantastic shadow that the natives were accustomed to consider as the\\nevidence of a friendly and jocular disposition. Every line that could\\npossibly be interpreted into a secret inclination for war, was carefully\\navoided; while, on the other hand, he studied those conceits that might\\nbe construed into amity.\\n\\nIn short, he entirely sacrificed every appearance of the warrior to the\\nmasquerade of a buffoon. Such exhibitions were not uncommon among the\\nIndians; and as Duncan was already sufficiently disguised in his dress,\\nthere certainly did exist some reason for believing that, with his\\nknowledge of French, he might pass for a juggler from Ticonderoga,\\nstraggling among the allied and friendly tribes.\\n\\nWhen he was thought to be sufficiently painted, the scout gave him much\\nfriendly advice; concerted signals, and appointed the place where they\\nshould meet, in the event of mutual success. The parting between Munro\\nand his young friend was more melancholy; still, the former submitted to\\nthe separation with an indifference that his warm and honest nature\\nwould never have permitted in a more healthful state of mind. The scout\\nled Heyward aside, and acquainted him with his intention to leave the\\nveteran in some safe encampment, in charge of Chingachgook, while he and\\nUncas pursued their inquiries among the people they had reason to\\nbelieve were Delawares. Then renewing his cautions and advice, he\\nconcluded by saying, with a solemnity and warmth of feeling, with which\\nDuncan was deeply touched:\\n\\n\"And now God bless you! You have shown a spirit that I like; for it is\\nthe gift of youth, more especially one of warm blood and a stout heart.\\nBut believe the warning of a man who has reason to know all he says to\\nbe true. You will have occasion for your best manhood, and for a sharper\\nwit than what is to be gathered in books, afore you outdo the cunning,\\nor get the better of the courage of a Mingo. God bless you! if the\\nHurons master your scalp, rely on the promise of one who has two stout\\nwarriors to back him. They shall pay for their victory, with a life for\\nevery hair it holds. I say, young gentleman, may Providence bless your\\nundertaking, which is altogether for good; and remember, that to outwit\\nthe knaves it is lawful to practise things that may not be naturally the\\ngift of a white skin.\"\\n\\nDuncan shook his worthy and reluctant associate warmly by the hand, once\\nmore recommended his aged friend to his care, and returning his good\\nwishes, he motioned to David to proceed. Hawkeye gazed after the\\nhigh-spirited and adventurous young man for several moments, in open\\nadmiration; then shaking his head doubtingly, he turned, and led his own\\ndivision of the party into the concealment of the forest.\\n\\nThe route taken by Duncan and David lay directly across the clearing of\\nthe beavers, and along the margin of their pond.\\n\\nWhen the former found himself alone with one so simple, and so little\\nqualified to render any assistance in desperate emergencies, he first\\nbegan to be sensible of the difficulties of the task he had undertaken.\\nThe fading light increased the gloominess of the bleak and savage\\nwilderness that stretched so far on every side of him; and there was\\neven a fearful character in the stillness of those little huts, that he\\nknew were so abundantly peopled. It struck him, as he gazed at the\\nadmirable structures and the wonderful precautions of their sagacious\\ninmates, that even the brutes of these vast wilds were possessed of an\\ninstinct nearly commensurate with his own reason; and he could not\\nreflect, without anxiety, on the unequal contest that he had so rashly\\ncourted. Then came the glowing image of Alice; her distress; her actual\\ndanger; and all the peril of his situation was forgotten. Cheering\\nDavid, he moved on with the light and vigorous step of youth and\\nenterprise.\\n\\nAfter making nearly a semicircle around the pond, they diverged from the\\nwater-course, and began to ascend to the level of a slight elevation in\\nthat bottom land, over which they journeyed. Within half an hour they\\ngained the margin of another opening that bore all the signs of having\\nbeen also made by the beavers, and which those sagacious animals had\\nprobably been induced, by some accident, to abandon, for the more\\neligible position they now occupied. A very natural sensation caused\\nDuncan to hesitate a moment, unwilling to leave the cover of their bushy\\npath, as a man pauses to collect his energies before he essays any\\nhazardous experiment, in which he is secretly conscious they will all be\\nneeded. He profited by the halt, to gather such information as might be\\nobtained from his short and hasty glances.\\n\\nOn the opposite side of the clearing, and near the point where the brook\\ntumbled over some rocks, from a still higher level, some fifty or sixty\\nlodges, rudely fabricated of logs, brush, and earth intermingled, were\\nto be discovered. They were arranged without any order, and seemed to be\\nconstructed with very little attention to neatness or beauty. Indeed, so\\nvery inferior were they in the two latter particulars to the village\\nDuncan had just seen, that he began to expect a second surprise, no less\\nastonishing than the former. This expectation was in no degree\\ndiminished, when, by the doubtful twilight, he beheld twenty or thirty\\nforms rising alternately from the cover of the tall, coarse grass, in\\nfront of the lodges, and then sinking again from the sight, as it were\\nto burrow in the earth. By the sudden and hasty glimpses that he caught\\nof these figures, they seemed more like dark glancing spectres, or some\\nother unearthly beings, than creatures fashioned with the ordinary and\\nvulgar materials of flesh and blood. A gaunt, naked form was seen, for a\\nsingle instant, tossing its arms wildly in the air, and then the spot it\\nhad filled was vacant; the figure appearing suddenly in some other and\\ndistant place, or being succeeded by another, possessing the same\\nmysterious character. David, observing that his companion lingered,\\npursued the direction of his gaze, and in some measure recalled the\\nrecollection of Heyward, by speaking.\\n\\n\"There is much fruitful soil uncultivated here,\" he said; \"and I may\\nadd, without the sinful leaven of self-commendation, that since my short\\nsojourn in these heathenish abodes, much good seed has been scattered by\\nthe wayside.\"\\n\\n\"The tribes are fonder of the chase than of the arts of men of labor,\"\\nreturned the unconscious Duncan, still gazing at the objects of his\\nwonder.\\n\\n\"It is rather joy than labor to the spirit, to lift up the voice in\\npraise; but sadly do these boys abuse their gifts. Rarely have I found\\nany of their age, on whom nature has so freely bestowed the elements of\\npsalmody; and surely, surely, there are none who neglect them more.\\nThree nights have I now tarried here, and three several times have I\\nassembled the urchins to join in sacred song; and as often have they\\nresponded to my efforts with whoopings and howlings that have chilled my\\nsoul!\"\\n\\n\"Of whom speak you?\"\\n\\n\"Of those children of the devil, who waste the precious moments in\\nyonder idle antics. Ah! the wholesome restraint of discipline is but\\nlittle known among this self-abandoned people. In a country of birches,\\na rod is never seen; and it ought not to appear a marvel in my eyes,\\nthat the choicest blessings of Providence are wasted in such cries as\\nthese.\"\\n\\nDavid closed his ears against the juvenile pack, whose yell just then\\nrang shrilly through the forest; and Duncan, suffering his lip to curl,\\nas in mockery of his own superstition, said firmly:\\n\\n\"We will proceed.\"\\n\\nWithout removing the safeguards from his ears, the master of song\\ncomplied, and together they pursued their way towards what David was\\nsometimes wont to call \"the tents of the Philistines.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n']"
